### Session 14
*Seedtime 1-2*
- After the initiation ceremony into [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin's Horde\|Ogdin's Horde]], the party joined in the libations and festivities that went late into the evening, all making their way home throughout the night
- Long Rest
- [[People/Other Adventurers/Pointy\|Pointy]] was antsy in the morning, and communicated to [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]] and [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]] that he wanted to go to a glade in [[Places/The High Forest\|The High Forest]]
- Party went to see [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Dutch 'The Boozer King' Ottenbrau\|Dutch 'The Boozer King' Ottenbrau]], but his house seemed like he hadn't been home in days
- Talking to his neighbor [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Yarr Xibloes\|Yarr Xibloes]], Nira offered an apprenticeship on the sheep ranch to his daughter [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Zuri Xibloes\|Zuri Xibloes]]
- The party gathered some well water to analyze, Aired drank some
- Stopped by [[Places/Tam's Forge and Blacksmith Shop\|Tam's Forge and Blacksmith Shop]] to pick up some shiny "treasures" for [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Goop\|Goop]]
- Went to the [[Places/Reeve's Manor\|Reeve's Manor]] to collect the bounty for [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bitts Goldcrest\|Bitts Goldcrest]], but [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bailey Fanteaser\|Bailey Fanteaser]] seemed to have lost it, there was evidence that Goop may have taken it
- At [[Places/The Bursting Barrel\|The Bursting Barrel]] they saw blood leading from the kitchen to Dutch who was unconscious, [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] revived him and he explained how he had been shot with a phantom bolt last night
- They told him they suspected [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Gerthwin Bartelby\|Gerthwin Bartelby]] was dead from the shapeshifter and he felt guilty for letting it happen, but told them to notify her next of kin in the city of Yartar
- In the stable [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Clarence\|Clarence]] showed no signs of intelligence beyond that of a normal horse
- Went to [[Places/Geshtai's Chapel\|Geshtai's Chapel]], ran into [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/'Greasy' Greg Gremble\|'Greasy' Greg Gremble]] who gave them two freshly brewed potions of *Darkvision* and collected the well water sample to test
- Talked to [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Brother Collamir\|Brother Collamir]] who mentioned a spring in the High Forest that is said to help animals grow large, and he gave rough directions to get there as the party set out following Pointy
- Came to a cliff and saw something flying overhead carrying a squealing pig, two halflings burst out chasing after it
- The party sprang into action, attacking what turned out to be a [Manticore](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16951-manticore) which attacked ruthlessly with tail spikes
- After sustaining significant damage the Manticore dropped the pig and Rip leapt off the cliff to catch it with *Feather Fall*, but mistimed the jump
- [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]] used *Repelling Blast* to help Rip get to the falling pig, where he barely managed to catch the squealing animal and tumble down to the bottom of the cliff
- Nira finished off the Manticore after it dropped [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]], then the party and halflings repelled down the cliff to harvest the Manticore
- The halflings introduced themselves as Nikki and Ben, and with some insight the party realized they sell herbal remedies and risky drugs such as **Hero's Wort** and **Tantric Truffles**, which they gave to the party as thanks for saving their pig, Floyd
- Short rest
### Session 13
*Seedtime 1*
- The party decided what to do with the Sea Hag they had captured and charmed with *Suggestion*, and split up to cover more ground
- [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]], [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]], and [[People/Player Characters/Feannag MacDamhan\|Feannag MacDamhan]] went up to [[Places/Geshtai's Chapel\|Geshtai's Chapel]] and convinced [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Sister Tasarda\|Sister Tasarda]] to give them more blessings for the children, she expects some sort of donation to the chapel in return
- On the way back they looked around the poisoned well directly above the hag's lair, Cock dove in and saw some bubbles but otherwise just managed to drink some cursed water
- In the lair [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] calmed [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bitts Goldcrest\|Bitts Goldcrest]] down and got her hands mostly free, while [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]] and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Zuri Xibloes\|Zuri Xibloes]] chatted about Sheep #38, who Zuri calls "Dollie"
- The kids told the party that they were swallowed by a toad while playing in the shallows and they woke up here, Wrenn tried to communicate with the large toad, but it seemed to be unnatural and undead
- The party looked around the lair, found more growing hands, mousetraps, and some interesting items: a piece of fish skin with dots corresponding to curse victims, a golden chain necklace, a ring, a mermaid disguise and many seaweed and bone [fetishes](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fetish) and dolls
- Using the *Blessings of Geshtai*, the party returned the children to the surface and to their families.  [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Yarr Xibloes\|Yarr Xibloes]] was grateful and gave them the 10GP reward, the Goldcrest butler told them to go see [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Reeve Fona Goldcrest\|Reeve Fona Goldcrest]] about the 500GP reward
- One of the fishermen in the village had died from a phantom crossbow bolt, likely due to the curse of protection from the hag
- Nira wanted to get the sheep out of the lair, so she had the undead toad swallow it then used the *Crook of Command* to make the sheep roll the toad forward and out of the lair
- Alone with the toad on the surface Nira attacked it to try to free the sheep, but it instead knocked her unconscious and swallowed her, shrinking back to it's small size just as Cock caught up to it
- Feannag and Aired were able to retrieve Nira and the sheep, but they remained tiny when taken from the toad's mouth, they then killed the toad and burned the body
- Returning to the lair where the hag was still captive, they creatively used rain to clear out some of the smoke from the hag's brew that was keeping her protected, they then tied the hag down using rope and the immovable rod
- Knowing that they had only one chance before the hag broke the charm, the entire party piled on huge attacks on the [Sea Hag](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17008-sea-hag), killing her instantly without allowing her to use her protection curse
- They got to work harvesting the hag's psyche, hair, claws, and some skin, then looted the lair and left
- Now the evening they dried off and went to [[Places/Ogdin's Overlook\|Ogdin's Overlook]] to take part in the remaining trials to join the horde
- Before oaths to the horde were taken, [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin The Anvil\|Ogdin The Anvil]] offered a chance for anyone to object to an initiate joining the horde, and Aired stepped up to challenge [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Grund Razorclaw\|Grund Razorclaw]], using his ring that matched one Grund carried as proof that he had raided his village and killed his friend years ago
- The horde of barbarians formed a ring and pushed Grund and Aired, unarmed and unarmored, into the arena for a duel for their honor
- Grund used his rage to take many hits and unleash devastating punches, but his sloppy style proved no match for Aired's deft maneuvering and Flurry of Blows, which knocked Grund unconscious
- Aired was given the chance to decide Grund's fate, and when Grund showed no remorse he sent the orc clan away, denying them entry to the horde
- The last trial was the Trial of Pain, and each member of the party who took part in the Kruthik extermination was to use their recovered spines to inscribe magical tattoos on their body without passing out from pain
- Aired was the first to succeed using his fey ancestry, joining the horde and swearing the oath as well as his oath to **grant freedom from bondage**
- Cock followed on his second try, swearing the oath in Ogdin's exact voice and swearing to **seek truth in tradition**
- Wrenn was the final member to join on their second attempt, swearing to **protect the weak**
- Each of their new tattoos granted special magical power in different ways depending on their sworn oath, and the horde closed in to welcome them with a night of drinking and revelry
### Session 12
*Greenwake 45-Seedtime 1*
- [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]] came to consciousness in the Kruthik tunnels while being carried by [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Grund Razorclaw\|Grund Razorclaw]] and noticed that his earring was actually the elven ring owned by his friend before she died in an orc raid
- Aired was put in the infirmary and had his injuries tended to by [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Gudbrand the Elder\|Gudbrand the Elder]], but wasn't able to convince him about what happened in the tunnels
- He then snuck out of Ogdin's encampment, made his way to [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]]'s barn and passed out in a haystack
- In the morning Aired rejoined the party and told them about his tragic backstory, the group decided to kill Grund and his orc crew and pin it on the shapeshifter
- The party went to [[Places/Geshtai's Chapel\|Geshtai's Chapel]] where [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Brother Collamir\|Brother Collamir]] was cleaning up the mess from when [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Foke Barnswaggle\|Foke Barnswaggle]] transformed into a Sea Spawn and attacked them after his curse was lifted
- He taught the party about Sea Hags; their weird magic that doesn't seem to obey rules, that they love to offer bargains that end poorly for those that take them, and that they hate beauty above all else
- The party came up with a plan to set a trap at a mock beauty pageant by the river to catch the hag
- Outside they ran into [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/'Greasy' Greg Gremble\|'Greasy' Greg Gremble]], who sold them some potions and bomb-making supplies as well as offered to turn their Kruthik saliva into potions of darkvision
- [[People/Player Characters/Feannag MacDamhan\|Feannag MacDamhan]] went with Greg and spent the day learning about how to use an alchemy kit to make explosive charges, meanwhile [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] made some bomb casings at the forge
- The rest of the party set up an elaborate trap by the rivers edge, using fake flyers littered in the river to lure the hag to their pageant, where Nira was in disguise as a contestant
- As she looked in the water she saw horrifying visions, then was attacked by two Sea Spawn sent by the hag to wreck the pageant, the party dispatched them quickly
- Using Blessings of Geshtai to breathe underwater they then went into the depths of the lake to seek out the hag's lair, finding a grotesque garden of rotting hands reaching up through the lakebed outside a cave
- Wrenn, unable to swim in full armor, is grabbed by one of the hands and the hag is alerted to their presence
- Inside they found themselves in a small grotto that reeked of fish and low tide, detritus and odd artifacts littered the ground along with increasingly complex Rube-Goldberg-esqe contraptions that the party assumed to be mousetraps.  They also saw the two missing children ([[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bitts Goldcrest\|Bitts Goldcrest]] and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Zuri Xibloes\|Zuri Xibloes]]) and Nira's sheep in cages, in the center the hag stood on a platform stirring a massive bubbling cauldron
- She said she had been expecting them and asked if they brought gifts, then Nira was able to surmise that the hag might be afraid of mice, and used a silent image to scare her into dropping her illusion, revealing Bitts at the cauldron and her true self in one of the cages
- She offered them many bargains in exchange for the children and sheep, but the party refused, instead shooting her with a crossbow, which she instantly seemed to heal from
- The hag explained that any damage she took would be absorbed by the life force of the poisoned villagers, so they shouldn't bother trying to kill her
- Instead the party took aim at her precious cauldron, with Wrenn and [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]] shattering it quickly as she sprung into combat, however the attack was short lived as [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]] caught the hag with Suggestion, telling her to sit and be quiet for a few hours while they thought of a plan to break the curse
### Session 11
*Greenwake 45-Seedtime 1*
- In the morning Feannag and [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] poked around at the bombs they had found, successfully disassembling them and reverse engineering ice, acid, and grease bombs.  In the process of reassembling them Feannag set off the ice bomb in his face, losing the existing bombs but gaining the knowledge of how to make more
- Nira and Cock tracked the missing sheep to the river's edge, where they saw tracks leading straight into the water.  Nira felt a slight mental pulse of energy through the Crook of Command that indicated the missing sheep was below the river bank
- Together they rappelled down the overhanging bank and went for a swim and saw that there seemed to be an underwater cave entrance down there
