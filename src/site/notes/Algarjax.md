Algarjax is a plasmoid scribe who sees to clerical work on the treasure barge of [[Places/Arnesport\|Arnesport]].  Timid and bookish he mostly keeps to himself but can be quite gregarious once [[Anihala\|Anihala]] has pumped a few strong drinks into his gelatinous form.  He is on [[People/Player Characters/Erastus Wyndhoek\|Erastus Wyndhoek]]'s crew but is not a capable fighter.
