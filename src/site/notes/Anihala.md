Anihala is a tiefling warlock who grew up as an urchin on the streets of [[Places/Arnesport\|Arnesport]] before joining a pirate crew.  She always wanted to helm a ship but needed access to arcane magic to learn spelljamming, leading her to a pact with her infernal ancestors.  Even with this bargain her crew didn't allow her anywhere near the helm, leading her to become jaded and disillusioned.  Her first opportunity to fly a ship was as the helmsman of the Treasure Barge under [[People/Player Characters/Erastus Wyndhoek\|Erastus Wyndhoek]], lowly gruntwork compared to the grandeur of a space galleon.  Her drinking buddy [[Algarjax\|Algarjax]] is also a part of this crew.
