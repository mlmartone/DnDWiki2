[[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bailey Fanteaser\|Bailey Fanteaser]] claims to have been abducted by the [[Kiba System/Psurlons\|Psurlons]] during the Battle of Grey Hawk, but his memory of the incident is fuzzy at best.  He says they were really nice to him and just asked him some questions and that they were angels and celestials and beautiful beings of pure light (which doesn't match up with any of the bug-monsters and worms that you all saw).  Also he has been acting strangely ever since, coordinated, organized, and really put together which is not at all like the Bailey you know.  Maybe someone should look into it.
