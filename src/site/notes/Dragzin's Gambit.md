A dice game for two players played across [[Places/Faerun\|Faerun]].  
1. Ante up: Players agree on a wager
2. Roll: Both players roll a full set of 7 polyhedral dice (1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 2d10, 1d12, 1d20)
3. Raise: One or both players may raise the bet (optional) or fold if they don't want to take the raise
4. Round 1:
	-  Both players secretly indicate which dice they would like to spend this round (can be none)
	- They simultaneously reveal and count the total sum of their spent dice this round
		- The Bollocks: Two of the same number played in a given round doubles the total (4 and 4 gives 16 total)
		- The Flick: Playing a 1 nullifies the opponent's highest single die once per round, this may prevent the double scoring of the Bollocks if one is removed
	- The highest total wins the round, spent dice are set aside
5. Raise: One or both players may raise the bet (optional) or fold if they don't want to take the raise
6. Round 2
