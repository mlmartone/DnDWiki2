*Ship's Log X*: While traversing the horrifying darkness of the Shadowfell you heard insane cackling coming from nearby along with a raspy voice counting limbs.  When his back was turned Aired was ambushed by something that cleanly cleaved his left arm off at the shoulder then disappeared before anyone could get a look at it.  You fled the scene along with Redley, who had been hemmed in by this creature for days, but you could hear it cackling in the dark behind you.  What was this terrifying creature?  Where did it come from and will it strike again?
