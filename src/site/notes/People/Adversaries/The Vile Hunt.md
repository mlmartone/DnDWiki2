This evil group seeks to snuff out all intelligent animals, believing that animals who can speak are abominations.  This has led to purges in many locations but perhaps the most heinous is their forays into [[Places/The Beastlands\|The Beastlands]] to hunt down petitioners in their afterlives, sending them to oblivion when their souls are destroyed.  They use weapons very similar to those of the **Black Saints** and are likely connected in some way.
