The most volatile and aggressive pirate captain of [[Places/Arnesport\|Arnesport]] is of course the one for whom death has no consequences.  No one knows who Cap'n Flameskull was in life or how they ended up as a powerful undead necropirate, but that doesn't seem to bother them as they bombard, blast, and detonate their way through their victims' hulls.  Flameskull's dreadful cackle sends chills down even the most steely spines, and they commands a legion of skeletons who have a reputation for leaving none alive.  The dead soon rise again to join their ranks, reanimated with the ghostly green fire of Flameskull in their scorched eye sockets.
