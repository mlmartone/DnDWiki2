The only Pirate Lord to sit upon the Council of [[Places/Arnesport\|Arnesport]] with only a single ship under her command, Deadeye Hollins is the epitome of quality over quantity.  Her crew is made up of fiercely loyal pirates who fight in perfect tandem to take down targets much larger than themselves.  This is of course easier when the opposing captain is dead before the fight even starts from a crossbow bolt through the eye, Deadeye's calling card.
