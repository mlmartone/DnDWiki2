Flarexius is a young Solar Dragon of the most recent brood in *Realmspace*.  His mother, who resides in the star at the center of the system and who is an ancient solar dragon capable of claiming the entire system as her territory, recently turned her brood loose to learn to hunt and live on their own, and Flarexius stumbled upon the dealer's flagship.  He has become an honorary crew member and something of a mascot to the pirates of the vessel, but serves an important function guarding the massive treasure hoard accumulated onboard.  He is inquisitive, rambunctious, and something of a 'widdle scamp.
