Golden-Fang was one of the few pirate captains in [[Places/Arnesport\|Arnesport]] that did not swear allegiance to any particular member of the [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Council of Pirate Lords\|Council of Pirate Lords]].  Instead he was seeking to make a name for himself when he led a raid on [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Lord Tarly Wyndhoek\|Lord Tarly Wyndhoek]]'s mansion, killing Tarly's oldest son in the process and making off with quite a bit of booty despite [[People/Player Characters/Erastus Wyndhoek\|Erastus Wyndhoek]]'s best efforts.  That was over a year ago and he hadn't resurface until he reappeared acting as First Mate on [[People/Arnesport Citizens/The Dealer\|The Dealer]]'s flagship, and wielding a sword stolen from Erastus.
