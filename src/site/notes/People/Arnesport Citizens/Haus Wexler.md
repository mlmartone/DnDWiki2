Captain Haus Wexler is one of the esteemed members of the Council of [[Places/Arnesport\|Arnesport]] and the captain of a small fleet of pirate vessels.  Rather than concern himself with the fickle whims of a mutinous pirate crew, Wexler has created a small army of automatons and constructs to fly intelligent ships, effectively automating the entire piracy process.  Not the most effective combatants hand-to-hand, his fleet relies on overwhelming firepower and the sheer feat of engineering that is his flagship *The Icarus*.
