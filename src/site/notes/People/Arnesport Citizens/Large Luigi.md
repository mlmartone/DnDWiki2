Large Luigi is the owner and barkeep of The Happy Beholder in [[Places/Arnesport\|Arnesport]].  He is a beholder who prefers to collect information by serving as hub of travelers through Realmspace rather than tyrannical oppression the way most beholders would.  He is a jovial spirit but doesn't put up with nonsense and has no problem using his powerful anti-magic eyes and eye-beams to defend the tavern or force payment from delinquents.
