Lord Tarly Wyndhoek inherited his piracy empire from his father and has carried on the legacy admirably.  While in his youth he captained a vessel himself, he now commands his fleet from the comfort of his mansion in [[Places/Arnesport\|Arnesport]].  He specializes in extremely targeted piracy, using spy networks to gain intel on key transports in order to secure rare artifacts or valuable prisoner ransoms through ambushes where the odds are stacked overwhelmingly in his favor.  This intel network has gained him enough renown to act as [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Amber Arnes\|Amber Arnes]]'s right hand on the Council of Arnesport.  He also oversees the system of taxation in the city to make sure the dragon [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Selunius\|Selunius]] gets her requested tithe of silver each month.
