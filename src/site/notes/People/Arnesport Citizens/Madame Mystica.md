Madame Mystica is a pillar of [[Places/Arnesport\|Arnesport]], acting as a fortune teller and oracle for the many superstitious ship captains that dock in the city.  She dispenses advice through her skills as a diviner but also has access to a huge network across the city that she can call upon for information or favors for the right price.  

UPDATE: Turns out Madame Mystica isn't the old crone she purports to be, that is just an illusion to improve business, but she is no less skilled of a diviner than she claims to be.
