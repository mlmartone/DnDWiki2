Redley is a space pirate captain operating out of [[Places/Arnesport\|Arnesport]] who is loyal to [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Taln Wolfheart\|Taln Wolfheart]] and lives in the [[Places/Sapling of Yggdrasil\|Sapling of Yggdrasil]].  He worked his way up from timid quartermaster's mate hired for his strength alone to the captain's chair by demonstrating bravery and fierce battle instincts.  He still wields an anchor and chain from his oceanic sailing days, and as a Path of the Giant Barbarian his size and strength are truly terrifying when he summons his rage.  

The party originally rescued Redley from [[People/Black Saints/The Limbcutter\|The Limbcutter]] and other unfathomable terrors lurking in the gloom of [[Places/The Shadowfell\|The Shadowfell]].  He had accidentally found his way there through a portal while training in the catacombs with some close pirate buddies, but in the dark they were separated and only Redley survived.  For this rescue he owes [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]], [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]], [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]], and [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]] a life-debt, which he is repaying by traveling with them on their mission to defeat [[People/Arnesport Citizens/The Dealer\|The Dealer]].
