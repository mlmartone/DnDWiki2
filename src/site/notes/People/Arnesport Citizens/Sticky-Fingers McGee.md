Many crews of pirates and outlaws find themselves obeying some sort of code, honor among thieves, or at least respecting the chain of command of their vessel.  Those that are too antisocial to handle even the loose structure of pirate life often find their way to the employ of Sticky-Fingers McGee, a shadowy captain who takes what he wants when he wants from whoever he can.  His rough and tumble band are a disorganized and unpredictable bunch, constantly scheming against each other to cut a bigger share of the booty.  He was begrudgingly made a member of the Council of [[Places/Arnesport\|Arnesport]] when the other members decided it was easier than proving that he was behind all of the robberies of their mansions that seemed to happen whenever the council would meet to keep them occupied.  Since then the inter-crew thievery has slowed, but if Sticky-Fingers gets a whiff of something that interests him no bonds will stop him from stealing it.
