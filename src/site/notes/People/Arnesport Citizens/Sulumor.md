Sulumor is [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Selunius\|Selunius]]'s "pet" and prisoner as of when the party visited her lair.  He is an ancient elf who is afraid of his curse and his inability to control it around others.  He was freed from his prison by [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]] but wasn't willing to help them fight and was gone by the time the party left the temple.
