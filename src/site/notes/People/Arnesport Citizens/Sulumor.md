Sulumor is [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Selunius\|Selunius]]'s "pet" and prisoner as of when the party visited her lair.  He is an ancient elf who is afraid of his curse and his inability to control it around others.  He was freed from his prison by [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]] but wasn't willing to help them fight and was gone by the time the party left the temple.  

UPDATE: The party realized that Sulumor was the Prime Werewolf and the originator of the curse of lycanthropy.  They tracked him to his lair in the lunar wastes where they met the ghost of his daughter who told them her tragic story.  In a bid to release [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] from the curse they killed Sulumor and cut out the heart of the Prime Werewolf.
