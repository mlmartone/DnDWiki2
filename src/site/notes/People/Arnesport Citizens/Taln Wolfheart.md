Captain Taln Wolfheart is the most recent addition to the Council of [[Places/Arnesport\|Arnesport]].  This relatively young and unconnected human has made an outsize impression over his only ten years of life in Arnesport.  He started as a nautical pirate along the Sword Coast of [[Places/Faerun/Faerun\|Faerun]], transitioning to space piracy once he commandeered a spelljamming vessel by happenstance.  

His crew operates out of a base in a massive Sapling of Yggdrasil that sprung up in the center of Arnesport when he buried a stolen *Seed of the World Tree* along with the rest of his treasure.  The crew is known for harnessing beastial rage in brutal hand-to hand combat.  Taln is a charismatic and promiscuous captain who swaggers about with the brash self-assuredness of a rising star, yet to find a challenge he couldn't talk or fight his way out of.
