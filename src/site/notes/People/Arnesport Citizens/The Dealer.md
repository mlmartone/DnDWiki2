In the last year The Dealer has been growing bolder and bolder as a space-pirate captain around [[Places/Arnesport\|Arnesport]].  No one knows who he is or where he came from but he has begun to trouble major shipping routes and even prey upon other pirate vessels in the region.  Notable missing ship captains include Haus Wexler, "Deadeye" Hollins, Sticky-Fingers McGee, and Norman Wyndhoek.
