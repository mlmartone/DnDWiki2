Thunivel is a deadly assassin and captain of his own small Spelljamming vessel.  He serves as [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Taln Wolfheart\|Taln Wolfheart]]'s "fixer," making sure no one lives to tell tales Taln doesn't want told.  Though he keeps them well hidden he wields dual pistols that seem to link him to the Black Saints.
