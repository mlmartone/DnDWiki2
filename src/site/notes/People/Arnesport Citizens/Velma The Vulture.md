Velma "The Vulture" Varthman came up through [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Taln Wolfheart\|Taln Wolfheart]]'s crew, but her tendency to leave the fighting to others and then swoop in for easy pickings got her a bad reputation with his crew that prioritized brute-force fighting.  She struck out on her own, unaffiliated with a captain from the [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Council of Pirate Lords\|Council of Pirate Lords]], but disappeared a few months back.  She reappeared working for [[People/Arnesport Citizens/The Dealer\|The Dealer]] when she successfully defeated the crew of [[People/Player Characters/Sea Bastion\|Sea Bastion]] in the *Battle over Arnesport*.  

She was tricked into eternal servitude to the Djinn by someone.
