The stench of death and decay follows Worms around as he slinks through the shadows.  He has become the personal assistant to Captain [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Taln Wolfheart\|Taln Wolfheart]] but he also serves [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Thunivel\|Thunivel]].  He seems to be up to no good and has been seen entering the dark catacombs of the [[Places/Sapling of Yggdrasil\|Sapling of Yggdrasil]].
