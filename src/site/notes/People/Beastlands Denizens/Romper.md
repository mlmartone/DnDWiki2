Romper is a [Grey Render](https://5e.tools/bestiary/gray-render-mtf.html), a large monstrosity that is a terror in battle and trained as a vicious bloodhound companion for a hunter.  He was raised in captivity by [[People/Adversaries/The Vile Hunt\|The Vile Hunt]], but was beaten for being the runt of the litter.  [[People/Beastlands Denizens/Trisfina\|Trisfina]] rescued him and they bonded, becoming inseparable and a joint force to be reckoned with.
