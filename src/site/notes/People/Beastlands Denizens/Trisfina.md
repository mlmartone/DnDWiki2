Trisfina is a wood elf who was born and raised in a small village in [[Places/Faerun/The High Forest\|The High Forest]], the same home of [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]].  She was only a young girl when [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Grund Razorclaw\|Grund Razorclaw]] and his band of orc raiders attacked the village, killed her older sister, and chased her out of town.  Pursued by two orc beserkers she fled through the woods and hid in an opening in a massive oak tree, which happened to be a portal to [[Places/The Beastlands\|The Beastlands]], which closed behind her.  Stuck in a punishing environment she grew to be a skilled ranger, becoming deadly with a bow and learning to blend into the environment with her chameleon-like color-shifting skin (a trait gained in the Beastlands).  

She has befriended many petitioners in the region such as [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Clarence\|Clarence]] and [[People/Beastlands Denizens/Duuza\|Duuza]], and has bonded with [[People/Beastlands Denizens/Romper\|Romper]] after rescuing him from [[People/Adversaries/The Vile Hunt\|The Vile Hunt]].  She still fears the Hunters, but harries them with guerilla tactics when she can.  

UPDATE: Now that she isn't the helpless little girl they chased into the woods, she is interested in taking down Grund's band of orcs before they destroy her adopted home.  

UPDATE: With Grund's orcs dead she has indicated that she would be interested in joining Aired in returning to their home at some point for a visit, but she is concerned about bringing Romper, whose raw destructive potential is unrivaled.  She might leave him in the Beastlands for a few days but only if the Vile Hunt was dealt with first so she knew he would be safe.
