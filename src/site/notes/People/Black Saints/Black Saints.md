The Black Saints are a shadowy guild of elite assassins operating out of [[Places/Phylornel\|Phylornel]] in [[Places/The Shadowfell\|The Shadowfell]].  Members may be from any race, socioeconomic class, plane of origin, alignment, or background, but all operate using sentient weapons that are far beyond the technology available in [[Places/Faerun/Faerun\|Faerun]].  The guild operates one of the most brutal and effective hives of assassins anywhere in the planes. It ensures the efficacy of its members by constantly siccing one against another, keeping their numbers small and removing the cruft of the weak.  

Members receive missions and instructions from their bonded weapons, which act as patrons bestowing combat prowess and other powers to their wielders.  Some missions are optional such as taking on killing contracts through the guild, others are not optional, such as seeking out and destroying other members.  The mechanisms by which these missions are doled out are highly secretive, as are the leaders and hierarchy of the organization.  

[[People/Beastlands Denizens/The Vile Hunt\|The Vile Hunt]] also uses similar weapons and seem to be connected to the Black Saints.
