Pi'za is the name of the sentient weapon which grants [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]] his warlock powers.  The weapon will speak through Cock sometimes and is bloodthirsty and cruel, especially when it comes to defeating adversaries from the [[People/Black Saints/Black Saints\|Black Saints]].  Occasionally Pi'za will inform Cock of a new target he is tasked with seeking out and assassinating to satisfy his end of the warlock pact, and each time he fulfills such a mission Pi'za grows stronger.  

Upon visiting [[Places/The Shadowfell\|The Shadowfell]] Pi'za was able to return to his true form, that of a shade of an ancient Netherese archmage and artificer bent on creating some of the most powerful magical weapons to ever exist.  He, along with the rest of the shades in [[Places/Phylornel\|Phylornel]], make up the arsenal and strategic core of the Black Saints, though he rarely gives any insight into internal dealings or motives.
