No one has seen the Limbcutter, only heard its cackling mad laughter and ominous counting coming from the dark in [[Places/The Shadowfell\|The Shadowfell]].  It strikes quickly and can hack off limbs with frightening precision, as [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]] learned the hard way.  It was driven off when the party saved [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Redley\|Redley]], but it still lurks in the darkness between the portal to the [[Places/Sapling of Yggdrasil\|Sapling of Yggdrasil]] and [[Places/Phylornel\|Phylornel]].
