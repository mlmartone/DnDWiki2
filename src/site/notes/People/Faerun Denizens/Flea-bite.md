One of the goblins who killed the druids and took over the spring in the depths of [[Places/Faerun/The High Forest\|The High Forest]], but surrendered to the party when they killed his boss.  Flea-bite helped to disarm traps and find a safe path through the goblin-infested areas of the forest.  He claims to owe the party a favor for letting him live.
