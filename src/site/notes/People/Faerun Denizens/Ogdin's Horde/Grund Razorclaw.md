Grund is a druid barbarian orc who is new to [[People/Faerun Denizens/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin's Horde\|Ogdin's Horde]] this year.  He bears a brand of a skull with three claw marks through it, and he is joined by what remains of his old clan (Grath, Grall, Gruk, Grum, and Griz).  He is mostly concerned with the sharpness of his trusty battleaxe, but can also turn into fearsome wildshapes in battle.  

UPDATE: Grund and his cronies were kicked out of the Horde, fled to [[Places/The Beastlands\|The Beastlands]], built a fort, and started running an animal fighting ring.  They were dispatched by the party with [[People/Beastlands Denizens/Trisfina\|Trisfina]] and [[People/Beastlands Denizens/Romper\|Romper]]'s help (and some poisoned ale).
