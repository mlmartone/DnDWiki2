Sigbjorn is a frenzied bererker who channels his rage to devastating effect on the battlefield.  However, he is a pacifist at heart, brought up in the brutal cold of mountain clans where war and raiding were the only means the had to survive the harsh conditions.  His clan of raiders relied on their rage to push their battle prowess, but in Sigbjorn that rage is fueled by a frustration with the need for conflict in the first place, and so as he does his grim work with his twin battleaxes each kill adds to his fury at the world for putting him in this position.  
When his clan hit a noble's caravan venturing into the mountain pass, a hefty bounty was placed on his head.  [[People/Faerun Denizens/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin's Horde\|Ogdin's Horde]] captured him in an attempt to collect the bounty, but Sigbjorn appealed to [[People/Faerun Denizens/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin The Anvil\|Ogdin The Anvil]]'s respect for strength and belief in second chances.  He was given a chance to join the Horde, and has been traveling with the group for a few months now, relieved to have a chance to put his deadly skills to use for good, or at least neutral causes.  
He also hates ice.  It's coarse and rough and it gets everywhere.  

UPDATE: Turns out he was killed and being impersonated by the shapeshifter.
