A black pseudodragon and former companion of L'Arsene before her untimely death, this curious creature has begun to bond with [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]].  It can communicate images and emotions telepathically and enjoys frozen meat from the Bag of Colding, and clearly wants to be out of these dark tunnels.  

UPDATE: Pointy was raised by [[People/Faerun Denizens/Tild\|Tild]] in [[Places/Faerun/The High Forest\|The High Forest]] and has been bonded to [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]] as a familiar in a ceremony.
