A powerful and well-studied wizard who was a prodigy of the School of Graviturgy at Strixhaven, Gabriella is very book-smart, but has very little real-world experience. She is only 18 and this quest with Alduin the first chance she had to go see the world, try out her powers, and continue her studies of the mysteries of the Astral Plane. The effects of a generational curse on her family by a eldritch god has rendered her legs useless, though she is plenty mobile in her Flying Chair, which she designed herself and constantly improves upon. In one of her forays into the Astral Plane she met Splish, a space guppy who she bonded with and she keeps as a companion on her journeys.
