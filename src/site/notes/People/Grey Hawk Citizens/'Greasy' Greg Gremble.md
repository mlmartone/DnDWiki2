'Greasy' Greg is a hermit who lives at the edge of [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]] who spends his life looking for and collecting "Fluids of Inconceivable Peculiarity" to catalog their effects and synthesize experimental concoctions. "If it flows, I knows," Greg is deeply proud of his catalog of vials and experiments on himself frequently, but his specialty is in lubricants and glues. Most of the town avoids Greasy Greg unless they need two things stuck together or unstuck.  

Seedtime 5: Greg was seen suspiciously walking away from the guards' quarters as it burned down.  He was known to be mad about the arrest of his sister [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Nora Gremble\|Nora Gremble]] earlier that day.
