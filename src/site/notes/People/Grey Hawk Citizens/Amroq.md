Amroq is a noble Djinn, an immortal air elemental with immense power to grant *Wishes* and bend the fabric of reality.  He keeps his true name hidden, for any who know it can use a certain magical ring to gain control over him, keeping him until wishes are granted.  His last master was [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Reeve Fona Goldcrest\|Reeve Fona Goldcrest]], who kept the ring in the study of the [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Reeve's Manor\|Reeve's Manor]] in [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]].  He has been bound to her family for generations and is possibly the source of their "noble" origins, and as a result he despises her.  The ring along with Amroq himself were stolen by [[People/Player Characters/Feannag MacDamhan\|Feannag MacDamhan]], [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]], [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]], [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]], and [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]], keeping him trapped in their *Bag of Colding* until he was released by [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Velma The Vulture\|Velma The Vulture]].  After winning their freedom the party doomed Velma and her crew to eternal servitude to Amroq in his mansion in the *Plane of Elemental Air*, and were granted a wish by Amroq, who gladly *Planeshifted* them back to their ship, happy to finally be rid of Grey Hawk denizens.
