Bailey would lose his head if it wasn't attached, he is constantly looking for something he misplaced, a running joke among the other townsfolk. Naturally Bailey is one of the clerks who oversees day-to-day accounting for the [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]]'s limited government and acts as a personal assistant to [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Reeve Fona Goldcrest\|Reeve Fona Goldcrest]], who is constantly exasperated with his foolishness.  

Seedtime 2: Bailey was thrown in the stockade as punishment for losing a large sum of gold that was meant to be the reward for the return of [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bitts Goldcrest\|Bitts Goldcrest]].  

Seedtime 5: Bailey was broken out of the stockade by a mob angry at the Reeve.  He was subsequently abducted by an alien ship in an encounter he recalls as pleasant, and now seems much more coordinated than usual.  He has been pardoned by the Reeve following the battle.
