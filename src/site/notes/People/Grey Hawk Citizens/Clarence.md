[[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Nora Gremble\|Nora Gremble]]'s horse.  He goes where he wants and is majestic as fuck about it.  

He often wanders in [[Places/Faerun/The High Forest\|The High Forest]], and was last seen near a giant oak tree that seemed to have some sort of doorway in it along with druidic runes.  

It turns out Clarence isn't a normal horse, he is a petitioner, the soul of a long-dead druid who passed into The Beastlands for the afterlife, but uses the doorway in the oak to return to the Material Plane regularly.
