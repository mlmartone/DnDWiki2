Dug is a half-dwarf who loves digging but is very claustrophobic, so naturally he took the job of town undertaker in [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]].  He is mostly solitary, living in his hut overlooking the town graveyard and tending to his garden.  He has never married and has no strong feelings on the matter.  

Seedtime 5: Dug perished in the Battle of Grey Hawk when the aliens tracked the orb to the graveyard near his hut.
