Dutch is a quarter-orc who lives down at the bottom of the [[Places/Grey Hawk Falls\|Grey Hawk Falls]] and makes his living hauling fishing nets and bringing the fish up to the town. He's a heavy drinker and spends nearly every night in [[Places/The Bursting Barrel\|The Bursting Barrel]] challenging anyone who looks at him sideways to a drinking contest. Locals know they can't beat him, but he can usually get sloshed off of foreigners' coin won in bets. He's thick-skulled and belligerent, but doesn't make trouble, in fact he often acts as the tavern's de-facto bouncer when he's not too deep in his ale.
