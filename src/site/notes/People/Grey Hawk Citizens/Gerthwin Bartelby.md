The owner and barkeep at [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/The Bursting Barrel\|The Bursting Barrel]], the local rough-and-tumble tavern in [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]]. She has seen everything come through her doors at least once, but runs a tight ship, taking pride in her establishment as the gathering place of the locals. She knows everyone in town and has a big heart, but isn't above charging double if you're too drunk too notice.

Gerthwin disappeared and was replaced by the shapeshifter at some point.  It is unlikely that she survived the encounter.
