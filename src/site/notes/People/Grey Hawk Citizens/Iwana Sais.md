Iwana lives with her husband [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Simon Sais\|Simon Sais]] at the eastern edge of [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]].  She was born and raised in the town and met Simon a few years ago when he moved in for logging.  She has been troubled by banging on her door the last few nights.  

Her mother came back from the dead to tell her she is pregnant and that the baby is some sort of dangerous monster.  

She has been ill and showing signs of a curse with her rapidly-progressing pregnancy, and is being tended to in [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Geshtai's Chapel\|Geshtai's Chapel]].  

Seedtime 9: Iwana's entire pregnancy lasted only two weeks and the baby is both healthy and seeming to grow stronger every day.  She's thrilled but it seems suspicious.
