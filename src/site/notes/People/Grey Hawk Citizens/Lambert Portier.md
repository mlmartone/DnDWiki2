Lambert met his wife [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Reeve Fona Goldcrest\|Reeve Fona Goldcrest]] in the academy in Waterdeep, though they didn't get along at the time.  Later their parents arranged for them to be married as part of a deal to extend the Portier shipping monopoly up the [[Places/Dessarin River\|Dessarin River]] to [[Places/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]].  Despising small town life Lambert avoids most contact with the townsfolk and is often hidden away in the [[Places/Reeve's Manor\|Reeve's Manor]] or conveniently on an errand to a city for months at a time.  However when he is around [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Dutch 'The Boozer King' Ottenbrau\|Dutch 'The Boozer King' Ottenbrau]] is often asked to bring casks of wine, ale, or whiskey to the manor to slake his thirst.
