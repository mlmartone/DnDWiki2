Reka runs a small shop in the [[Places/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]] market called Bobs and Bits, but lately she's fallen on hard times since her husband passed away a few years ago. She's a kindly old woman who just can't seem to catch a break and owes some money to some shady figures that she used to make ends meet.

On Greenwake 42 Reka was murdered in front of [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Simon Sais\|Simon Sais]]'s house in the early hours of the morning.
