The Garlicle is a crotchety fey that was awakened from a bush near [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]]'s house by [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Saoirse\|Saoirse]], the Sea Hag, as a spy on the party.  However he was just gaining sentience when she was defeated and so now is a free-willed, future-seeing bulb of sentient garlic.  You know, normal D&D stuff.
