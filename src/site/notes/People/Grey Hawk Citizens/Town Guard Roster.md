[[Places/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]] is protected by a small contingent of guards paid for and run by [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Reeve Fona Goldcrest\|Reeve Fona Goldcrest]] who work out of the Guard's Quarters next to the [[Places/Reeve's Manor\|Reeve's Manor]].  There are six guards on fully time duty, with two on guard at any given time.  Their main responsibilities are to collect tolls on the bridge and generally keep the peace, but they occasionally get pulled into arresting criminals, defending the town, and keeping and eye on the Reeve's Manor at night.  

*Bartholomew Barnswaggle*: A lug of a man who is a bit timid despite his powerful build.  Unlike his brother [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Foke Barnswaggle\|Foke Barnswaggle]], he didn't have the skill for farming and happily took up guard duties.  

*Phillip Pewtercrest*: Phillip is a frequenter of [[Places/The Bursting Barrel\|The Bursting Barrel]] and a known dice cheat to those in the town.  He doesn't seem to take his guard duties very seriously.  His surname was made up by the townsfolk when they realized his father was a previous Reeve's bastard.  

*Luzie O'Dell*: [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Honey O'Dell\|Honey O'Dell]]'s much more down-to-earth sister is a half-elf who is saving every copper she can from her guard salary to make sure her father is well-cared-for so she can move somewhere, anywhere else.  

*Samo Stug*: Samo's scars tell the story of his life right on his face and (often bared) chest.  He is a grizzled old warrior and retired mercenary who decided to settle down when his last contract nearly got him killed with an arrow to the knee.  

*Suki Stillwater*: The fact that Suki is has been courted by Honey O'Dell for the last few years is an open secret in the town.  She was just passing through the town as part of a merchant's caravan and decided to stick around for Honey and is guarding the bridge to make ends meet until they can elope.  

*Perce Pewtercrest*: Phillip's father and captain of the town guard, he takes his role much more seriously than his son.  Perce is technically the Reeve's half-brother, but he would never sully the Reeve's name by bringing that up.
