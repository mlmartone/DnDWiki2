Alduin's younger cousin and half-halfling (jokingly called a three-quarter-man), Hubert never inherited his family's imposing stature, dashing good looks, or natural charisma. As a boy he was taken under Alduin's wing as a squire, a favor he would never forget as he always dreamed of knighthood for himself someday. That was over thirty years ago and Hubert is quickly moving past his prime, though he still hopes to one day take up a Paladin's Oath, for now he mostly does menial tasks for his adventuring party.
