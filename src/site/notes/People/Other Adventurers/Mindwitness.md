This horrifying aberration is the result of a Beholder being infected with a Mindflayer tadpole.  It has formidable psionic powers and retains the eye-beams of Beholders, but it is a relatively docile creature that lives to serve the most intelligent beings around it.  It can speak telepathically to those around it and read minds, and like the [[Kiba System/Psurlons\|Psurlons]] it can acquire information and memories by consuming the brains of victims.  

This one was previously in service of the Psurlons but was captured by the party and [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Orbital Strike\|Orbital Strike]].  [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Gabriella Starsyx\|Gabriella Starsyx]] and [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Void\|Void]] saw value in keeping it alive though [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]] and his paladins wanted to destroy it.  The party stole the Mindwitness, along with the ship, and it now serves the most intelligent member, which is currently [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]].
