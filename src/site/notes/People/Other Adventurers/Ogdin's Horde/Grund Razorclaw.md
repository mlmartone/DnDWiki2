Grund is a druid barbarian orc who is new to [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin's Horde\|Ogdin's Horde]] this year.  He bears a brand of a skull with three claw marks through it, and he is joined by what remains of his old clan (Grath, Grall, Gruk, Grum, and Griz).  He is mostly concerned with the sharpness of his trusty battleaxe, but can also turn into fearsome wildshapes in battle.
