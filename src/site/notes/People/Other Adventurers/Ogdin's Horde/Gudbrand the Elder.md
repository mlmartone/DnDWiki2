Gudbrand is an old orc monk and a founding member of [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin's Horde\|Ogdin's Horde]].  Not many wandering orcs make it to old age in Faerun, so those that do possess special talents that they use to deadly effect.  Gudbrand is covered head to toe in tatoos that seem to shift and animate on his skin, and rumor has it that they give him some sort of power in combat.  Gudbrand, though he forsook the brutish rage of the orc god Grummush, honors his heritage with a powerful fighting style that he uses to put down those who would challenge Ogdin's orders.  He is the elder of the horde and [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin The Anvil\|Ogdin The Anvil]]'s second in command.
