This powerful group of 30-40 nomadic barbarians is well known in the lands between the [[Places/Faerun/Dessarin River\|Dessarin River]] and the Nether Mountains as a force generally for good but, definitely not to be trifled with.  Their leader, [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin The Anvil\|Ogdin The Anvil]], oversees the group and makes deals with those they meet on the road to find work for the crew.  Most time this is mercenary work fit for the group of ex-cons and bruisers, but often they will take on challenges such as bounty hunting, cult eradication, and even one time dragon slaying.

The horde lives by the principle of valor through strength, and their founding ideal is that a member's history is washed clean when they take the oath and complete the trials to join the horde.  For this reason many of their members are former outlaws, raiders, and outcasts, who see the horde as a chance to get a fresh start.  Ogdin will not hesitate to punish members who break the hospitality of the towns they visit, and will tolerate no one who might sully his name by acting in an evil manner while a member of his horde.  However, he will also go to great lengths to protect members from consequences of actions taken before they joined the horde.  Several members were originally bounty targets Ogdin was chasing before they chose to join.  
Twice a year during the spring and autumn equinoxes the horde visits [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]] to perform a ritual for inducting new members.  This ritual is shrouded in secrecy and takes place up on [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Ogdin's Overlook\|Ogdin's Overlook]].  However, they usually spend most of their time in [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/The Bursting Barrel\|The Bursting Barrel]] rabble rousing, brawling, drinking, and feasting.
