Thorgeir is a half-orc fighter and a member of [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin's Horde\|Ogdin's Horde]].  When in town he is a frequent drinking buddy of [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]], and enjoys dicing almost as much as he enjoys knocking heads together in a fight.
