A powerful and well-studied wizard who was a prodigy of the School of Graviturgy at Strixhaven, Gabriella is very book-smart, but has very little real-world experience. She is only 18 and this quest with Alduin the first chance she had to go see the world, try out her powers, and continue her studies of the mysteries of the Astral Plane.
