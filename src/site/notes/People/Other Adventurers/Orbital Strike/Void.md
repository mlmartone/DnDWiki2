Void is a mysterious, dark, masked ranger.  They trained to hunt the horrors of deep space and to become one with the darkness itself. When Void's family was attacked by an organized cult, they tracked one of the perpetrators to Faerun, and have been on it's tail ever since it escaped Candlekeep with the stolen artifact. Void prefers to keep to themselves and does not speak, emote, or otherwise have interactions they deem unnecessary, preferring to observe keenly from the shadows.
