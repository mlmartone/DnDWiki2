Wood elves are said to be skeptical and reclusive, sometimes to the point of asceticism and contempt. These words have never been said about Aired. The village knows this leaf licker as a paradox: a lucid drunk, an insightful fool, an acrobatic klutz. One day years ago, he stumbled into [[Places/The Bursting Barrel\|the Bursting Barrel]] and picked a fight with [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Dutch 'The Boozer King' Ottenbrau\|Dutch 'The Boozer King' Ottenbrau]]. The tavern cheered as Dutch threw the bark sniffer over tables and into the rafters. Aired tumbled and sailed with a performer’s grace. He and Dutch have been buddies ever since, and it’s no secret that [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Gerthwin Bartelby\|Gerthwin Bartelby]] loves the nightly show. The stingy barkeep makes a fuss over his tab on the wall and bed in the stable, but she never kicks him out. Nobody knows where this vagabond is from. We think somewhere in [[Places/The High Forest\|The High Forest]], but he’s never mentioned it. He might have forgotten.
