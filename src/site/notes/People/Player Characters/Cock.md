Cock is a generally pleasant fellow, except for when he isn't. Every day, he loses his memory, which kinda sucks because as a Kenku he can only mimic things he's heard. He keeps a journal to remind himself events, sort of like the video at the end of 50 First Dates. Actually, this whole thing is sort of like 50 First Dates. If Drew Barrymore were a bird. Who had a talking gun. Otherwise, basically the same thing. It may even make more sense. 

The journal he carries only chronicles his life since he started living in [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]], which was about five years ago. Since moving to Grey Hawk to be near his brother [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]], he started working as a Scarecrow on [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]]'s farm (wildly misunderstanding the whole concept). 

He has a big scary mysterious patron who talks to him through his gun. Sometimes his gun stabs him. The gun is a pizza. 

Since nobody has ever seen the patron, we don't actually know if it's big. Or mysterious. Archetypically, you would expect it to be those things, but I suppose there's no reason it can't be a talking Pomeranian with a really deep voice.
