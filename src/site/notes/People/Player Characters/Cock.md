Cock is only the latest of the many names taken on by this kleptomaniac kenku.  Growing up as an urchin on the streets of Yartar he was called Clink (or in Kenku sound-naming convention the sound of coins hitting each other).  This name took on another meaning when he was frequently in-and-out of jail for petty crimes such as pickpocketing and the occasional storefront robbery.  One such time Clink's cellmate was a member of the local thieves guild, and the connection lasted after their sentences were served.  He finally felt like he had a stable home, even if it was in the hidden backroom of a shady pub funded by a steady source of income from jobs handed down from the guild.  

He and his brother, Rip, worked as local toughs for the guild for a few years until one day they were robbing a wealthy merchant's estate on behalf of the guild when they were caught by his guards.  Thinking this would be just another routine trip to prison, Rip and Clink (only young teens at the time and unarmed), surrendered.  However the merchant had extrajudicial plans for these upstarts, and told his guards to take a hand from each of them as punishment.  As Clink watched, the guards took down a wicked-looking machete from the wall that seemed to be from some ancient brutal culture and prepared to maim his brother.  He had never been religious but he prayed to anyone who could help in his time of need.  Something answered, offering a deal which he took without pause as the guard raised the knife over the blindfolded Rip.  

That's where his memory of that night cuts out.  

Cock is a generally pleasant fellow, except for when he isn't. Every day, he loses his memory, which kinda sucks because as a Kenku he can only mimic things he's heard. He keeps a journal to remind himself events, sort of like the video at the end of 50 First Dates. Actually, this whole thing is sort of like 50 First Dates. If Drew Barrymore were a bird. Who had a talking gun. Otherwise, basically the same thing. It may even make more sense. 

The journal he carries only chronicles his life since he started living in [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]], which was about a year ago. Since moving to Grey Hawk to be near his brother [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]], he started working as a Scarecrow on [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]]'s farm (wildly misunderstanding the whole concept). 

He has a big scary mysterious patron who talks to him through his gun. Sometimes his gun stabs him. The gun is a pizza. 

Since nobody has ever seen the patron, we don't actually know if it's big. Or mysterious. Archetypically, you would expect it to be those things, but I suppose there's no reason it can't be a talking Pomeranian with a really deep voice.
