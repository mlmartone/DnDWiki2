Erastus Wyndhoek is the youngest son of Lord Tarly Wyndhoek. Compared to his older brothers, he does not possess the same level of intellect, a trait of which he has become quite self conscious. Because of this, he developed several coping strategies including rebelling against authority, feigning extensive knowledge, and building physical prowess. 

Despite being the black sheep of the family, he venerated his oldest brother, Norman, and constantly sought his validation. Unfortunately, his reckless behavior in an attempt to impress his brother during a raid ultimately led to his brother’s death, for which his parents disowned him and cast him out of their house. Though he resents his parents for this, he also feels deep shame for his role in his brother’s death and for being cast out of his family, secrets he has told nobody. He now wanders from place to place pretending to be on an important mission on behalf of his family as he seeks acceptance and purpose in life.
