Feannag came to [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]] about a year ago from [Waterdeep](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Waterdeep) looking for a fresh start and to escape “complicated family shit”. Despite being a city boy, he quickly found work on [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]]’s farm doing odd jobs and tending to the sheep in exchange for drinking money and a bed to sleep in. He quickly fell into the rhythm of country life, putting in long days on the farm and late nights trading stories with the locals at [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/The Bursting Barrel\|The Bursting Barrel]]. His sociability has made him generally well-liked throughout town, though his outspoken criticism of the town officials and general skepticism of powerful organizations has also earned him a reputation as a bit of a renegade.

Feannag was last seen locked in a fight to the death with [[People/Faerun Denizens/Orbital Strike/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]] as Nira's house burned down around him.  The party hadn't heard from him or Alduin since, until he tracked them down in [[Places/Arnesport\|Arnesport]] and the party learned he and Alduin killed each other and he was resurrected as a Revenant under [[People/Faerun Denizens/Orbital Strike/Gabriella Starsyx\|Gabriella Starsyx]]'s control, sent after the party to recover the [[Kiba System/Astral Orb\|Astral Orb]].  His revenant form was defeated and his spirit was free to move on to the afterlife, though the party hoped to truly resurrect the young man someday.  

With the help of the Djinni [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Amroq\|Amroq]], the party used their *Wish* to *Resurrect* Feannag back in Grey Hawk with the message that he must assassinate [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Reeve Fona Goldcrest\|Reeve Fona Goldcrest]].  He has no idea what happened since he died a week ago, he just knows that he's suddenly back and he must kill.
