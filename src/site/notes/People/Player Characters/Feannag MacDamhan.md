Feannag came to [[Places/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]] about a year ago from [Waterdeep](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Waterdeep) looking for a fresh start and to escape “complicated family shit”. Despite being a city boy, he quickly found work on [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]]’s farm doing odd jobs and tending to the sheep in exchange for drinking money and a bed to sleep in. He quickly fell into the rhythm of country life, putting in long days on the farm and late nights trading stories with the locals at [[Places/The Bursting Barrel\|The Bursting Barrel]]. His sociability has made him generally well-liked throughout town, though his outspoken criticism of the town officials and general skepticism of powerful organizations has also earned him a reputation as a bit of a renegade.
