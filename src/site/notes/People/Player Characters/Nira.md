Nira has lived in [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]] her whole life, learning how to tend to sheep, spin wool and knit from her parents. When they passed away she took over the farm for her own, and is well known around town for making the coziest sweaters gold can buy! A bit of a recluse who never married or had children, Nira's best friends are her 100 sheep that free roam around her farm. In the evenings she can often be found at [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/The Bursting Barrel\|The Bursting Barrel]], sipping a pint on her own (or sometimes with a sheep or 3). In her old age she's found it a bit difficult to tend to the farm on her own like she used to, so has hired on [[People/Player Characters/Feannag MacDamhan\|Feannag MacDamhan]] as a farm hand and [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]] as a scarecrow to keep things running smoothly for her flock. Its nice to have some non-livestock friends around, even if Nira has to pay them for their company!
