It’s not Rip's fault he likes shiny things - and it’s not his fault that taking those shiny things make life easier for his impoverished family. He didn’t turn to crime for the fun of it - he was always either trying to put bread on the table or get his older brother out of whatever mess he always seemed to get himself in. He didn’t like the job his brother seemed to have found - security work is what he called it - so Rip was understandably in way over his head when things suddenly went south. What follows is kind of hazy - Rip still isn’t sure what his brother did to get them out of that situation, or what happened to him in the years after he disappeared. All he knows is he wants to put that shady past behind him and lead an honest life as Greyhawk’s postal carrier, a job he finally is able to take pride in. In fact, in an effort to craft a new life for himself he’s gone all in on his work - being a postal carrier and a wizard he’s quite bookish and reads a lot. He knows a lot of random facts and obscure information, and he’s determined to find a better way to deliver correspondence faster, and make the postal service better for the people he serves. And don’t even THINK of calling him a carrier pigeon.
