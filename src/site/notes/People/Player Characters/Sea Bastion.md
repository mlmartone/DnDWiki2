A Lamprey Spelljamming Ship that formerly belonged to [[People/Astral Denizens/Serax-Dral\|Serax-Dral]]'s Psurlon fleet before it was brought down by an adventuring party, impounded by [[People/Faerun Denizens/Orbital Strike/Orbital Strike\|Orbital Strike]], then stolen and flown out of [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]] into Realmspace.  

The party now calls the rickety ship home and has made some upgrades with the help of [[People/Faerun Denizens/Orbital Strike/Void\|Void]], the [[People/Astral Denizens/Mindwitness\|Mindwitness]], and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/The Garlicle\|The Garlicle]], who also live aboard.  

Currently the ship is outfitted with a Library and a Workshop as facilities and a Ballista and an Arcane Magnifier as weapons (in addition to its grappling claw).
