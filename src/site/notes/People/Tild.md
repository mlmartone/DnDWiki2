Tild is an eccentric gnome who lives deep in [[Places/The High Forest\|The High Forest]] and has spent years perfecting primitive crafting techniques in an effort to please their god *Nebelun*.  Their current project is forging a single perfect ingot using no other metal tools or extensive magic.  Their cottage is surrounded by magical wards so they can craft in peace and enjoy the company of many pseudodragons that they consider children.  [[People/Other Adventurers/Pointy\|Pointy]] is one such pseudodragon and he has been bonded to the party by Tild's magic.  A powerful smith, tinkerer, and enchanter, Tild is a great resource for learning more about creating magical items.
