## World Introduction
The land of Faerun is a vast expanse of untamed magic and mystery, overseen by gods and only dotted with civilization.  Great expanses of the world are unexplored or unknown to those who live outside.  Humanoid civilization (a mixture of humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and halflings) has sprung up over the last few thousand years along the sword coast, with major cities like Neverwinter, Waterdeep, Candlekeep, and Baldur's Gate connected by road, oceanfaring ship, and of course teleportation magic.  This is only the latest chapter in eons of change, with empires rising and falling over the millennia leaving behind ruins and relics to be discovered by those willing to brave the wilds and dungeons of the world.

## Population
Countless other civilizations exist and interact with humanoid society, but there are few who can claim familiarity with even two, let alone all of them.  High and Wood elves have a network of cities and nations within the High Forest.  Dwarven cities such as Mirabar, Felbarr, and the Mithral Hall trade in ores mined from the impossibly high peaks of the Spine of the World in the north.  Halflings and Gnomes dot the landscape with settlements, but rarely form larger cities of their own.  Of course there are a plethora of other races present in northwest Faerun such as Tieflings, Orcs, Kenku, Dragonborn, Goblins, Aarakocra, Firbolg, Goliaths, Hobgoblins, Lizardfolk, Tritons, Tabaxi and Tortles to name just a few.  These may have their own secret cities, be fully integrated into the Sword Coast civilization, or anywhere in between.  
## Travel and Adventuring
Traveling through the wilds is no simple task and shouldn't be attempted without a guide, and even travel along well-known land or sea routes can be dangerous without protection.  For this reason few leave the regions or even villages in which they were born.  Those that do are known as Adventurers.  Often grouped together into parties of three to six, these Adventurers cross great distances in search of riches, secrets, or holy pilgrimages.  They may take on odd quests along their journeys or stay focused on their main objectives.  Few adventurers make it to old age, but those that do may become the stuff of legend.  
## Magic
The world of Faerun is inherently magical and a significant portion of the population can shape that magic to their will to some degree.  Some though wizardly study, others through wild natural magic surges, and yet others through divine (or infernal) intervention.  Many who pursue magical talents go on to become adventurers or end up moving to the larger cities where magic is common.  In small towns magic may be more rare, limited to a select few skilled healers or oracles, but few places eschew its influence altogether.  Masters of magic can be found in all forms, and some are willing to share their secrets with those they deem worthy.  
## Pantheon
In this world the gods are not only present but regularly intervene in the form of answered prayers and appointing champions.  There are more gods than can be counted, some long forgotten others ascending to godhood in living memory.  The [Dawn War Deities](https://dungeonsdragons.fandom.com/wiki/Dawn_War_pantheon) are some of the most commonly worshipped among humanoid society, but any pantheon can be invoked.  
## Economy
One constant across time and location is the luster of precious metals.  Gold, Silver, and Copper pieces serve as currency and are accepted in most civilized areas that trade with the outside world.  These coins may be minted in different regions or even predate recorded history, and a given gold piece could bear the mark of the current Duke of Baldur's Gate or it could show a forgotten deity that was slain in the Dawn War untold millennia ago, the value is still the same.  Commerce scale is entirely relative to location: a dragon may amass millions of gold pieces, royals may spend thousands of gold pieces on a single feast, a successful merchant may deal with hundreds of coins per day, and a farmer might net only a few dozen gold off of a successful harvest after providing for their family.  A few hundred gold can be a respectable savings to the local innkeeper, but a pittance to a vampire lord.  
## Calendar
The world follows an eight month seasonal calendar, divided into two 45 day months per season.  The year begins on the Midwinter Solstice and progresses as follows:
	**Icereign** (Late Winter)
	**Greenwake** (Early Spring)
	**Seedtime** (Late Spring)
	**Suncrown** (Early Summer)
	**Highheat** (Late Summer)
	**Harvesttime** (Early Fall)
	**Lightfade** (Late Fall)
	**Frostgrasp** (Early Winter)

*Our campaign started on the 40th day of Greenwake.*
