The upscale restaurant and inn situated across from the [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Reeve's Manor\|Reeve's Manor]] in [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]].  Frequented by the more well-to-do residents and catering to traveling nobles and merchants along [[Places/Faerun/The Wanderer's Path\|The Wanderer's Path]], this inn does not take kindly to rabble rousing like [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/The Bursting Barrel\|The Bursting Barrel]] does.
