Serving as the only building of worship in Grey Hawk, this chapel accepts worshippers of all deities, but it's architecture and monks serve Geshtai, the goddess of fresh water.  She is a lesser deity with few devout followers, but is commonly known and occasionally prayed to to bless water, cure poison, or in times of drought.  The chapel predates any recorded history of the town, even the bridge.  

The chapel is currently looked after by [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Brother Collamir\|Brother Collamir]] and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Sister Tasarda\|Sister Tasarda]], who happen to be actual siblings.  The chapel is a simple stone building that can hold about 30 people in the main worship area comfortably, with lots of built-in water features, a loft where the monks sleep, and some off-limits areas in the basement.  Out back there is a fresh pond that is populated with colorful fish that serves as a place for meditation and prayer to Geshtai.
