The village of [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]] is built overlooking the Grey Hawk Falls, a waterfall along the [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Dessarin River\|Dessarin River]] that drops about 100 feet into a deep lake before the river continues to flow out to sea.  The falls are so named because when looking at the right angle one can see the profile of a hawk's head in the stones near the top of the cliff.  Local legends say that it is the head of a guardian who used to protect the town in ancient times, but no one gives that much credit these days other than children.
