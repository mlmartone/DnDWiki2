Neverwinter is one of the largest cities on the Sword Coast of Faerun.  It is known for its craftsmen, wizarding academies, and as a bulwark against the wild lands to the north.  Many orders of fighters and paladins operate out of this massive city, including the Oath of the Watchers paladins, of whom [[People/Faerun Denizens/Orbital Strike/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]] is a member.  Their headquarters are located just outside the city, where many prisoners and powerful artifacts are kept under close guard lest they fall into evil hands.  One such artifact was the [[Kiba System/Astral Orb\|Astral Orb]].
