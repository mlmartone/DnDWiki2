The Long Road is a famous adventuring road that leads down the fabled sword coast from Mirabar to Waterdeep.  It is the inland route parallel to the High Road.  The Wanderer's Path is a trail that splits off of the Long Road somewhere to the southwest of  the Sword Mountains, heading up along the edge of [[Places/Faerun/The High Forest\|The High Forest]] and crossing the [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Dessarin River\|Dessarin River]] at the village of [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]].  It is lightly traveled, but not known to be a particularly dangerous route, making it ideal for travelers hoping to go inland into Faerun from the Sword Coast.
