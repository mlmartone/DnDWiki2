Located to the west of [[Places/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]] is a particularly steep hill that has become known as Ogdin's Overlook.  The villagers rarely have any reason to go there, but children are discouraged from playing on the rocky escarpments of the hill.  It is visited every spring and fall equinox by a traveling herd of barbarians, who stay in town for about a week each time and rarely make much trouble.  They have some sort of ritual that takes place in a ring of stones set at the top of the hill, but only the herd is allowed to know the details.
