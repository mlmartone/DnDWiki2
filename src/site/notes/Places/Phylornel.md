One last remnant of the once-great Netherese empire of [[Places/Faerun/Faerun\|Faerun]] has been hiding in the darkness of [[Places/The Shadowfell\|The Shadowfell]] for millennia. Over thousands of years in the inky blackness, the human mages that ruled the city have been turned into Shades and left their physical forms behind. Now they continue their arcane research with an eye towards creating the deadliest magical weapons.  Some, such as [[People/Black Saints/Pi'za\|Pi'za]], helm the secret assassin organization known as the [[People/Black Saints/Black Saints\|Black Saints]] from this citadel.  

The citadel is a hub for secret magical item trade and arcane fashion.  However, they use their own currency made of solidified darkness know as Shadow Talents (ST).  

Phylornel’s continued existence is a closely guarded secret enforced by the Black Saints, who will silence those who might let the secret slip.
