The Beastlands is one of the Outer Planes that surround the Prime Material Plane, and is the final resting place of souls who are deeply connected to nature.  It is the heaven for wild animals and animal companions who were good in life, as well as druids who were good-aligned.  These druid spirits, known as *Petitioners* take the form of talking animals in the Beastlands and retain much of their magical talents from life.

Krigala, the uppermost layer of the Beastlands is bathed in noon-time sunlight all of the time.  It is an infinite expanse of wilderness that is broken up into different habitats and biomes such as temperate forests, savannas, rainforests, swamps, or mountains by distinct dividing lines.  This layer has some extremely rare connections to the Material Plane, such as the portal hidden inside a massive oak tree in [[Places/Faerun/The High Forest\|The High Forest]].

Strange magic governs the plane, giving animals greater intelligence and cunning, allowing some to cast spells.  Humanoids who venture to the plane are overcome with longing to be one with nature, and when embraced this can invigorate them with a primal savagery and a hunger to hunt and be hunted.  It is said one feels most truly alive in the Beastlands.  However breaking the natural cycle by hunting for sport is punished by the primal magic of the land.  Killing without intent to consume prey results in transformation into the dead animal's species to maintain the natural order.
