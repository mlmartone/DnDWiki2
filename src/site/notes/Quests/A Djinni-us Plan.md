During the heist of the [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Reeve's Manor\|Reeve's Manor]], the party trapped a Djinni in the Bag of Colding.  At some point they will need to deal with it if they want to access any of the items in there, and it probably isn't at all happy with them.  

*Ship's Log 5*: After tricking the none-too-observant Djinni [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Amroq\|Amroq]] into taking [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Velma The Vulture\|Velma The Vulture]] captive instead of the party, they outsmarted him in a battle of wits and were granted their freedom along with a parting *Wish*.  Amroq has returned to his native *Plane of Elemental Air* where he lives in an opulent mansion.
