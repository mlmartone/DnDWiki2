*Ship's Log 1*: [[People/Player Characters/Erastus Wyndhoek\|Erastus Wyndhoek]] swore an oath as a Paladin of Conquest serving [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Selunius\|Selunius]], the lunar dragon.  Even though it was under duress, the oath is binding and grants him powers and an unbreakable bond to the evil ancient dragon.  Selunius has charged him with enacting her will on the city of [[Places/Arnesport\|Arnesport]] and venturing out into Wildspace to hunt down the most recent brood of Solar Dragon Wyrmlings that recently hatched.  Great rewards and power are given to her most trusted servants, disobedience is not tolerated.  

*Ship's Log 2*: Erastus has been elevated to the [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Council of Pirate Lords\|Council of Pirate Lords]] at Selunius's demand, the council isn't happy about it but they must bear with his presence at their meetings as the dragon's eyes and ears.
