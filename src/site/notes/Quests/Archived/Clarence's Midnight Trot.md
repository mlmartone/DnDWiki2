*Greenwake 40*: [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Nora Gremble\|Nora Gremble]]'s beloved horse, [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Clarence\|Clarence]] recently returned from a midnight trot covered in blood and clear marks of a beast attack.  He usually doesn't venture too far from town so that could be a problem if the next victim isn't so lucky.  

*Greenwake 41*: Also he seemed to magically heal overnight which is strange.  

*Greenwake 42*: Clarence was last seen going into a magical doorway in an ancient oak tree in a clearing in [[Places/Faerun/The High Forest\|The High Forest]].  

The doorway had Druidic runes underneath it.  

*Greenwake 44*: Having an animal read the runes opened a portal to *The Beastlands* and it turns out Clarence is a petitioner soul in the form of a horse who has been using this portal for at least a thousand years.  

*Seedtime 5*: The party fled with Clarence into *The Beastlands* where he finally spoke to them, thanking them for their help but admonishing them for letting the cruel orcs into his home.  We finally know exactly what he's been up to on his midnight trots.
