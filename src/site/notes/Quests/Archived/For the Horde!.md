*Greenwake 45*: The trials to join [[People/Faerun Denizens/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin's Horde\|Ogdin's Horde]] of Barbarians have begun!  The first trial is delving into the **Underdark** to clear out a nest of Kruthik.  Return with their spines to prove the deed has been done.  

Most of the party survived a full day in the twisting tunnels despite the constant threat of Kruthik attack.  They were able to gather several Kruthik spines and should now talk to [[People/Faerun Denizens/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin The Anvil\|Ogdin The Anvil]] or [[People/Faerun Denizens/Ogdin's Horde/Gudbrand the Elder\|Gudbrand the Elder]] to see what's next.
