*Greenwake 40*: [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Dutch 'The Boozer King' Ottenbrau\|Dutch 'The Boozer King' Ottenbrau]] mentioned the water was giving him headaches

*Greenwake 41*: [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Foke Barnswaggle\|Foke Barnswaggle]] said it was making him hear voices.  

*Greenwake 42*: [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Saoirse\|Saoirse]] said the lake is poisoned.  

[[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/'Greasy' Greg Gremble\|'Greasy' Greg Gremble]] thinks it's some sort of fey curse.  

*Greenwake 43*: Saoirse blamed [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Goop\|Goop]], but it turns out she is a Sea Hag, a powerful evil fey creature definitely able and willing to poison a well.  

*Seedtime 1*: [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Brother Collamir\|Brother Collamir]] said that Foke was cursed by the Sea Hag, but when he removed the curse he turned into a Sea Spawn.  

The party tracked down the Sea Hag's to her lair in a grotto at the bottom of the lake, there she admitted to poisoning the water with a concoction from her cauldron.  The poison makes it so that the affected act as shields for her, absorbing her damage.  The party shattered her cauldron, preventing her from making more of the poison.  

The party killed the hag and broke the curse on those poisoned by the well water.  It should dissipate in a few days.  

*Seedtime 2*: Greasy Greg took some well water to run tests.  

*Seedtime 4*: The tests came back clear and the well seems to be back to normal!
