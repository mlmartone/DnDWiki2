*Greenwake 44*: [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bitts Goldcrest\|Bitts Goldcrest]] and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Zuri Xibloes\|Zuri Xibloes]] have disappeared, they live in the fishing village in [[Places/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]] and often play by the water.  There is a 500GP and 10GP reward for their safe return respectively.  Could this be the work of the shapeshifter?  The Hag??  Clarence???  

*Seedtime 1*: The party found the two missing children in the Sea Hag's lair in the grotto below the lake.  

The children were returned to their homes safely, the 10GP reward was paid but not the 500GP reward.  

*Seedtime 2*: It seems that [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Goop\|Goop]] stole the 500GP reward because [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bailey Fanteaser\|Bailey Fanteaser]] lost it.  

*Seedtime 4*: Bailey has been put in the stockade as punishment for losing the reward money.  It was no small amount and he is likely to be permanently disgraced by this.  

[[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Reeve Fona Goldcrest\|Reeve Fona Goldcrest]] didn't have the cash to cover the reward so she offered a horse or jewelry in exchange, which the party unsuccessfully tried to haggle over, leading the Reeve to throw 15GP at them and call it even for their insolence.  

*Seedtime 5:* Deciding the Reeve to be untrustworthy, the party decided to break into the [[Places/Reeve's Manor\|Reeve's Manor]] and steal the ledger at the center of her fortune.  They managed to do so and also captured a Djinni who is loyal to the Reeve.  They used the book to barter for the 500GP reward from Goop.
