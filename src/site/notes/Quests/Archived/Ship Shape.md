An alien flying ship crashed on [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]]'s ranch during the Battle of Grey Hawk.  The party managed to acquire the helm used to control it and [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Gabriella Starsyx\|Gabriella Starsyx]] and [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Void\|Void]] think they might know how to repair the ship to get it flight-worthy again, if only they had the help of some artificers and enchanters.  

Also there is a beholder-mind flayer hybrid aberration onboard currently that should probably be dealt with first.
