An alien flying ship crashed on [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]]'s ranch during the Battle of Grey Hawk.  The party managed to acquire the helm used to control it and [[People/Faerun Denizens/Orbital Strike/Gabriella Starsyx\|Gabriella Starsyx]] and [[People/Faerun Denizens/Orbital Strike/Void\|Void]] think they might know how to repair the ship to get it flight-worthy again, if only they had the help of some artificers and enchanters.  

Also there is a beholder-mind flayer hybrid aberration onboard currently that should probably be dealt with first.  

*Seedtime 10*: The party, with the help of [[People/Faerun Denizens/Tild\|Tild]] and Void, was able to repair the ship's enchantment and get it off the ground.  The also befriended the [[People/Astral Denizens/Mindwitness\|Mindwitness]] and have taken it along with the ship out of [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]] and into space.
