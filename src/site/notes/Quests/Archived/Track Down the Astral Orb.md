Help [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Orbital Strike\|Orbital Strike]] find the stolen Astral Orb along with the shapechanging thief who took it.

*Greenwake 41*: Tony's Pajamas were found behind [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/The Bursting Barrel\|The Bursting Barrel]]

*Greenwake 42*: [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]] has been using *Zone of Truth* to interrogate everyone in the village and detain suspects.  

*Greenwake 44*: [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Gerthwin Bartelby\|Gerthwin Bartelby]] has had the orb, but now she's gone missing, was she the shapeshifter all along?  Evidence points to someone in [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin's Horde\|Ogdin's Horde]] now. 

*Greenwake 45*: [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Sigbjorn Hagisson\|Sigbjorn Hagisson]] was last seen causing a cave-in in the tunnels using a powerful psionic blast.  This surely could only mean that he is the dreaded shapeshifter.  

Alduin has set a bounty of 5000GP for the return of the fugitive and the Astral Orb.  Ogdin's Horde has taken on the contract for the bounty, believing the shapeshifter may be in their midst.  

*Seedtime 4*: The party noticed the *Amulet of Clarity* glowing in the presence of Ogdin's Horde, and after a brief fight they were able to reveal the shapeshifting fugitive, revert it to it's worm-like alien form, and capture it for Alduin to question.  The Astral Orb is still at large.  

*Seedtime 5*: [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin The Anvil\|Ogdin The Anvil]] finally remembered where he buried the orb while mind-controlled by Serax-Dral, the shapeshifter.  The party recovered the orb then fled with it to avoid being captured by alien reinforcements.
