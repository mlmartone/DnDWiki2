[[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Iwana Sais\|Iwana Sais]] and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Simon Sais\|Simon Sais]] heard a loud pounding and scratching on their door for the past few nights.  Nothing got through, but whatever it was wanted in badly.  [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Reka Rearguard\|Reka Rearguard]] was found murdered there the next day.  After a stakeout the party found that the culprit was the reanimated body of Iwana's mother Cima, who was shambling from the graveyard every night to try to warn her daughter about some sort of monster involved in her pregnancy.  She was at peace after she was able to tell her daughter to go see the clerics at the chapel for help.
