*Greenwake 41*: [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Iwana Sais\|Iwana Sais]] and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Simon Sais\|Simon Sais]] heard a loud pounding and scratching on their door for the past few nights.  Nothing got through, but whatever it was wanted in badly.  

*Greenwake 42*: [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Reka Rearguard\|Reka Rearguard]] was found murdered there the next day.  

After a stakeout the party found that the culprit was the reanimated body of Iwana's mother Cima, who was shambling from the graveyard every night to try to warn her daughter about some sort of monster involved in her pregnancy.  

She was at peace after she was able to tell her daughter to go see the clerics at the chapel for help.  

*Greenwake 43*: The clerics believe her pregnancy has been hijacked by some sort of powerful fey.  

*Seedtime 4*: Iwana's condition has worsened.  Since the hag died she has become visibly pregnant and silvery-blue veins cover her body.  She only sleeps fitfully and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Sister Tasarda\|Sister Tasarda]] is worried that this is beyond her skill to heal.  

*Seedtime 9*: The baby was born during the Battle of Grey Hawk after only a two-week pregnancy.  Everyone involved seems healthy and happy, but upon closer inspection the baby is shrouded in Illusion magic.
