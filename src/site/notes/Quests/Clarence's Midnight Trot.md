[[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Nora Gremble\|Nora Gremble]]'s beloved horse, [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Clarence\|Clarence]] recently returned from a midnight trot covered in blood and clear marks of a beast attack.  He usually doesn't venture too far from town so that could be a problem if the next victim isn't so lucky.  

Also he seemed to magically heal overnight which is strange.  

Clarence was last seen going into a magical doorway in an ancient oak tree in a clearing in [[Places/The High Forest\|The High Forest]].  

The doorway had Druidic runes underneath it.  

Having an animal read the runes opened a portal to *The Beastlands* and it turns out Clarence is a petitioner soul in the form of a horse who has been using this portal for at least a thousand years.
