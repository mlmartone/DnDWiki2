*Ship's Log 1*: The party witness the destruction of the *Icarus*, one of [[Places/Arnesport\|Arnesport]]'s most powerful warships captained by [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Haus Wexler\|Haus Wexler]] and an ominous warning was sent by a shady space pirate named [[People/Arnesport Citizens/The Dealer\|The Dealer]].  Now the moon is under blockade and all ships leaving must submit to inspection by the Dealer, and who knows what could happen if a ship surrenders to a known murderous pirate?  How do you plan to get off this rock?  

*Ship's Log 2*: [[People/Player Characters/Erastus Wyndhoek\|Erastus Wyndhoek]] attended a meeting of the [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Council of Pirate Lords\|Council of Pirate Lords]] where multiple plans for defeating the Dealer were presented.  
* [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Amber Arnes\|Amber Arnes]] wanted to slip past the blockade to call for allies to help
* [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Lord Tarly Wyndhoek\|Lord Tarly Wyndhoek]] wanted to listen to the Dealer's demands to try to reason with him
* [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Cap'n Flameskull\|Cap'n Flameskull]] as an unhinged pyromaniac wanted to engage in a full frontal assault on the Dealer's fleet
* [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Taln Wolfheart\|Taln Wolfheart]] wanted to try a daring mission to pretend to be captured and then dismantle the Dealer's flagship from within

*Ship's Log 4*: Taln has invited the party to join his strike force in infiltrating The Dealer's flagship.  The mission leaves in 20 hours.  

The party killed [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Yugin\|Yugin]], the other captain who was supposed to be involved in the mission and Taln will need a replacement (and probably an explanation).  

*Ship's Log 5*: The party saved [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Redley\|Redley]], another of [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Taln Wolfheart\|Taln Wolfheart]]'s captains and convinced him to replace [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Yugin\|Yugin]] in the assault.  They briefly met with the [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Council of Pirate Lords\|Council of Pirate Lords]], then used the cover of a frontal assault by [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Cap'n Flameskull\|Cap'n Flameskull]] to try to sneak aboard.  However, they were stopped and defeated by one of the Dealer's ships captained by [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Velma The Vulture\|Velma The Vulture]], before escaping.
