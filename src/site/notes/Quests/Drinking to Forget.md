*Greenwake 43*: [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]]'s troubled past has found him once again.  A group of orcs has joined [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin's Horde\|Ogdin's Horde]] bears the symbol of the raiders that burned his village in [[Places/Faerun/The High Forest\|The High Forest]] to the ground and killed many of his loved ones.  Maybe this is one way to get some closure.  They don't seem remorseful.  

*Seedtime 1*: Aired noticed that [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Grund Razorclaw\|Grund Razorclaw]] had a ring that matched the one taken from his friend when she died protecting the village years ago.  In the final trials of Ogdin's Horde he challenged Grund to a duel and defeated him in single unarmed combat.  Grund was exiled from the horde in disgrace, taking his orcs with him but vowing revenge for this.  

*Seedtime 4*: A few days ago there was an attack and Grund's crew robbed the inn before killing some of [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]]'s paladins and fleeing into [[Places/Faerun/The High Forest\|The High Forest]].  

*Seedtime 9*: With the help of [[People/Beastlands Denizens/Trisfina\|Trisfina]] and [[People/Beastlands Denizens/Romper\|Romper]] the orcs were finally defeated in their makeshift fort in [[Places/The Beastlands\|The Beastlands]].  Trisfina has mentioned she might like to join Aired in visiting their home village someday.
