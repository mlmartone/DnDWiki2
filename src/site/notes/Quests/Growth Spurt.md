[[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]] got eaten by a weird magic toad and now she's tiny.  That sucks.  

*Seedtime 2*: [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Brother Collamir\|Brother Collamir]] mentioned a magic spring that makes animals grow large somewhere in [[Places/The High Forest\|The High Forest]].  

The party found the spring, cleared out the goblins, and Nira drank the source water.  The spring guardian has asked for the party to send someone who can re-consecrate the grove.
