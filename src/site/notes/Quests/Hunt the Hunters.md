An evil group of killers known as [[People/Beastlands Denizens/The Vile Hunt\|The Vile Hunt]] have been plaguing [[Places/The Beastlands\|The Beastlands]] for centuries with their goal of snuffing out all intelligent animals that can speak.  More recently they have become even more of a problem as they have established a permanent camp to the south of the oaken portal and are killing petitioners at a much more concerning rate.  [[People/Beastlands Denizens/Duuza\|Duuza]] and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Clarence\|Clarence]], being prime targets, want them dead or driven off.  

*Seedtime 8*: Hunters attacked Clarence and the party was able to kill one and force the other to flee.  They were able to capture their strange weapons along with an annotated map of the Beastlands.
