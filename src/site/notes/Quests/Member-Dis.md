*Ship's Log 4*: While traversing the horrifying darkness of [[Places/The Shadowfell\|The Shadowfell]] you heard insane cackling coming from nearby along with a raspy voice counting limbs.  When his back was turned [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]] was ambushed by something that cleanly cleaved his left arm off at the shoulder then disappeared before anyone could get a look at it.  You fled the scene along with [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Redley\|Redley]], who had been hemmed in by this creature for days, but you could hear it cackling in the dark behind you.  What was this terrifying creature?  Where did it come from and will it strike again?  

*Ship's Log 5*: [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] was able to craft a magical prosthetic limb for Aired, but he still can sometimes feel phantom pain from his missing arm.
