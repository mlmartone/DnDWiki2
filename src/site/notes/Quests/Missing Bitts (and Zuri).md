*Greenwake 44*: [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bitts Goldcrest\|Bitts Goldcrest]] and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Zuri Xibloes\|Zuri Xibloes]] have disappeared, they live in the fishing village in [[Places/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]] and often play by the water.  There is a 500GP and 10GP reward for their safe return respectively.  Could this be the work of the shapeshifter?  The Hag??  Clarence???  

*Seedtime 1*: The party found the two missing children in the Sea Hag's lair in the grotto below the lake.  

The children were returned to their homes safely, the 10GP reward was paid but not the 500GP reward.  

*Seedtime 2*: It seems that [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Goop\|Goop]] stole the 500GP reward because [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bailey Fanteaser\|Bailey Fanteaser]] lost it.
