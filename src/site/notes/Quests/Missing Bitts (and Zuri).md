[[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bitts Goldcrest\|Bitts Goldcrest]] and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Zuri Xibloes\|Zuri Xibloes]] have disappeared, they live in the fishing village in [[Places/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]] and often play by the water.  There is a 500GP and 10GP reward for their safe return respectively.  Could this be the work of the shapeshifter?  The Hag??  Clarence???
