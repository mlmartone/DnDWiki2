*Greenwake 40*: [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]] found a sentient weapon that claims to know his forgotten past and has plans for him.  It is of a design no one has seen before and it grants him special powers.  Maybe look into that.

*Greenwake 43*: [[People/Adversaries/Xanla Dustfeet\|Xanla Dustfeet]] attacked Cock with a similar weapon, when she was killed Pi'za absorbed her weapon and gained power.  It said something about a shadowy organization known as the **Black Saints**.  

*Greenwake 45*: A mysterious man who claimed to have designed a similar weapon attacked the party, and when he died Pi'za was able to absorb his weapon to gain power.
