*Greenwake 40*: [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]] found a sentient weapon that claims to know his forgotten past and has plans for him.  It is of a design no one has seen before and it grants him special powers.  Maybe look into that.

*Greenwake 43*: [[People/Faerun Denizens/Xanla Dustfeet\|Xanla Dustfeet]] attacked Cock with a similar weapon, when she was killed Pi'za absorbed her weapon and gained power.  It said something about a shadowy organization known as the **Black Saints**.  

*Greenwake 45*: A mysterious man who claimed to have designed a similar weapon attacked the party, and when he died Pi'za was able to absorb his weapon to gain power.  

*Seedtime 4*: A Drow Wizard and his Fluxcharger golem crash landed in [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]] with clear orders to eliminate Cock written out.  The golem bore cannons that seemed similar to Pi'za, and the gun was eager to consume their essence as well as the golem's core.  

*Seedtime 8*: A group called [[People/Beastlands Denizens/The Vile Hunt\|The Vile Hunt]] is killing intelligent animals in [[Places/The Beastlands\|The Beastlands]] with weapons that look very similar to these.  Cock's weapon was able to absorb their weapons just like the others.
