The Astral Orb is in your possession and you managed to attune to it as a group.  This seems pretty serious as you are gaining power at an incredible rate and also blinking out of existence at random times.  

*Ship's Log 0*: A massive moon has appeared in the void inside the orb, it is crumbling apart and there is the charred remains of a destroyed village spread across the fractured surface.  

*Ship's Log 1*: [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]] was consumed by the orb's aberrant energy into an Awakened form of herself that was hostile to all life.  After she was defeated she was reborn as a lunar sorcerer with the locus of her power drawn from the moon inside the void in the orb, which had re-formed into a whole pristine white moon.
