The party came across the corpse of L'Arsene, a gnomish adventurer who was seeking the contents of a magical lab that had been sealed up and shunted into the Underdark so it wouldn't be found.  Clearly there is something dangerous in there, but also potentially artifacts of great power for those brave enough to seek them.  The party has a map of the facility, notes on it's history, and a passcode scrawled in gnomish.  Could it be the gigantic steel sphere found in the caverns beneath [[Places/Ogdin's Overlook\|Ogdin's Overlook]]?
