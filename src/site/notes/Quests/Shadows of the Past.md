*Ship's Log 4*: [[People/Player Characters/Erastus Wyndhoek\|Erastus Wyndhoek]] was accosted by a shady human who claims to know the party and that they betrayed him an everyone else they ever worked with.  He clearly has an axe to grind and isn't playing around, as [[People/Faerun Denizens/Orbital Strike/Void\|Void]] and the [[People/Astral Denizens/Mindwitness\|Mindwitness]] could tell you since they were nearly killed by this individual.  Who is this person?  Who sent them?  What past mistakes will come back to haunt the party next?  

[[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]] also found some of her homespun wool in the catacombs of the [[Places/Sapling of Yggdrasil\|Sapling of Yggdrasil]] in [[Places/Arnesport\|Arnesport]].  It seems like obvious bait, but who would have access to that material?  

*Ship's Log 5*: The assassin turned out to be their old friend [[People/Player Characters/Feannag MacDamhan\|Feannag MacDamhan]], or at least a raised revenant in his body commanded by [[People/Faerun Denizens/Orbital Strike/Gabriella Starsyx\|Gabriella Starsyx]] to track down the party and get the [[Kiba System/Astral Orb\|Astral Orb]].  He has been defeated, but now your friend lies dead and you don't know any magic that could bring him back... for now.  

*Ship's Log 5*: The Djinn [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Amroq\|Amroq]] forced [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]] to swear an oath to enact vengeance on [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Reeve Fona Goldcrest\|Reeve Fona Goldcrest]], which he fulfilled by *Wishing* the *Resurrection* of Feannag in [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]] to assassinate her.  This satisfied the Djinn's demands while also giving Feannag a second chance at life in the town, presumably without authority figures like the Reeve or [[People/Faerun Denizens/Orbital Strike/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]] bothering him anymore.
