*Ship's Log 1*: [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] was bitten by a werewolf in [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Selunius\|Selunius]]'s lair and has contracted lycanthropy, a curse that turns them into a chaotic evil beast in the presence of moonlight.  Wrenn has chosen not to embrace the beast within and so has no control over the form and wants to cleanse the curse as soon as possible.  

*Ship's Log 2:* [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Madame Mystica\|Madame Mystica]] has informed them that Wrenn's sire is none other than the Prime Werewolf, the originator of the curse and an incredibly powerful beast that lives as a hermit out in the lunar wastes.  She said the only ways to cure lycanthropy would be to kill the sire or to destroy an item of great value to him and use its essence to cast *Remove Curse*.
