Help [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Orbital Strike\|Orbital Strike]] find the stolen Astral Orb along with the shapechanging thief who took it.

*Greenwake 41*: Tony's Pajamas were found behind [[Places/The Bursting Barrel\|The Bursting Barrel]]

*Greenwake 42*: [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]] has been using *Zone of Truth* to interrogate everyone in the village and detain suspects.  

*Greenwake 44*: [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Gerthwin Bartelby\|Gerthwin Bartelby]] has had the orb, but now she's gone missing, was she the shapeshifter all along?  Evidence points to someone in [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin's Horde\|Ogdin's Horde]] now.  

*Greenwake 45*: [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Sigbjorn Hagisson\|Sigbjorn Hagisson]] was last seen causing a cave-in in the tunnels using a powerful psionic blast.  This surely could only mean that he is the dreaded shapeshifter.
