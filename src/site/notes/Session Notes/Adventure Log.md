### Session 18
*Seedtime 4*
- Started out in the aftermath of the fight to capture the shapeshifter
- Negotiated for half the reward with [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin The Anvil\|Ogdin The Anvil]] and got 1500GP early from [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]]
- Alduin and [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Gabriella Starsyx\|Gabriella Starsyx]] took the shifter away and imprisoned it for questioning, Gabriella seemed to have a bit of a crush on [[People/Player Characters/Feannag MacDamhan\|Feannag MacDamhan]]
- The party went back to Ogdin and split the reward money with him
- Went to the [[Places/Reeve's Manor\|Reeve's Manor]] to collect the reward that [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bailey Fanteaser\|Bailey Fanteaser]] lost for returning [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bitts Goldcrest\|Bitts Goldcrest]]
- A guard met them and informed them that they wouldn't be able to pay out the reward in gold right now, so the party could pick 5 items from [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Reeve Fona Goldcrest\|Reeve Fona Goldcrest]]'s jewelry collection or one of her horses as compensation
- He went to a wall safe and took out a lockbox that contained a ruby-encrusted tiara, an opal ring, a pearl necklace, and various precious metal bracelets, the party looked them over and then tried to haggle unsuccessfully with the guard
- They went across the street to the [[Places/Crescent's Rest\|Crescent's Rest]] where the Reeve was finishing up a meal, she was cordial at first but after Feannag started pointing out the limits of her power in the town and haggling poorly over the reward money she tossed 15GP at their feet and told them that's all the reward they would get
- The party went to a town guard on bridge duty named Bartholomew, whom they asked about the guards' salaries and toll collection duties and probed their loyalties to the Reeve
- They also talked to the other guard on duty, Phillip, who seemed open to taking bribes to let them free Bailey from the stocks
- Feannag was somewhat successful in getting both bridge guards to abandon their loyalties to the Reeve and join some sort of union or uprising in the town
- As they were talking to the guards the more perceptive members of the party heard a shout of surprise and looked up to see two humanoid figures flying in the sky above the town as they were zapped by the anti-flight wards Gabriella had put up and went hurtling down into the edge of [[Places/The High Forest\|The High Forest]]
- Entering the forest to investigate they found two craters, one with the broken body of a Drow Wizard still in it
- They collected his spellbook, dagger, magical armor, and papers which seemed to bear the mark of [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]]'s gun Pi'za along with a picture of his face and map to [[Places/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]]
- Cock, wanting to power up his weapon tried to shoot the corpse, but though Pi'za seemed amused by the grizzly gesture nothing happened
- At that moment a gigantic lightning-fueled golem appeared and began ruthlessly attacking Cock (and when he hid it targeted [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]]) with its dual arm cannons
- The party managed to defeat the [Fluxcharger](https://5e.tools/bestiary/fluxcharger-ggr.html) with a few key critical hits and weathered its lightning-storm death throes, then collected its *Lightning Core* and *Primordial Dust*, which Pi'za seemed eager to consume
