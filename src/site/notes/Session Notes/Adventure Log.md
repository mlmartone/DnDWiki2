### Session 38
*Ship's Log 1 (Arnesport Sunrise)*
- [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]]'s form began to bulge and writhe as it transformed, her chains breaking as tentacles sprouted from her back and she chanted in Deep Speech with a voice that was not her own
- The Astral Orb hovered right above her, spinning faster and faster as she drew power from it and became an Eldritch Aberrant version of herself
- As people tried to grab her suddenly everyone nearby was sucked into the orb including the party, [[People/Player Characters/Erastus Wyndhoek\|Erastus Wyndhoek]], [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Anihala\|Anihala]], [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Algarjax\|Algarjax]], and two of [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Selunius\|Selunius]]'s werewolf guards
- A fight ensued on the broken chunks of the moon that splintered across the void in the orb, Nira using her new powers to lash out with tentacles, summon aberrations, and deal tremendous psychic damage to the party with her screams
- The werewolves continued in their bloodlust to attack the party, [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] dealt with them but only after being bitten and cursed with lycanthropy themself
- As Nira was about to kill [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]] he blasted her with his gun, sending her spinning backwards through space where a random stray bullet that had been whizzing around in the orb struck her and sent her into the crevasses of the fractured moon
- A moment later there was a radiant burst of light from the moon as it began to reform violently, chunks of rock spinning around and crashing into the surface as gravity pulled the pieces together and formed a new, whole moon once more
- Nira the Lunar Sorceress was reborn, stronger and with this new moon in the orb as her source of Lunar power, she rejected the eldritch power that had taken hold and managed to bind it into a crystalline shard that empowered her spells
- Everyone was ejected from the orb except Nira and back into Selunius's lair, a few hours had passed and there was no sign of the dragon nor her cultists
- Back in the main chamber a grisly scene was laid out before the party: blood and viscera smeared over the walls and floor, countless cultist bodies torn apart by fangs and claws with bloody tracks leading out the door and into the lunar wastes
- [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] and Cock looted the cultists for armor and money, but as they boarded the ship Wrenn entered the moonlight and began to transform into a werewolf, bloodlust filling their eyes as they lunged for their friends in a frenzy
- [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]] subdued them and they were wrapped in a blanket to be hidden from the moonlight where they returned to gnomish form
- The group crossed the lunar wastes back to [[Places/Arnesport\|Arnesport]] without trouble, but wondering what had become of Nira in the orb
### Session 39
*Ship's Log 2 (Arnesport Morning)*
* Upon docking in [[Places/Arnesport\|Arnesport]] [[People/Player Characters/Erastus Wyndhoek\|Erastus Wyndhoek]] was verbally assaulted by a guard at the dock who called him a traitor and said [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Selunius\|Selunius]] had visited the city to inform them that he was now her champion and to put him on the council to speak for her
* [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]] picked the guard's pocket as he left, got his gloves, gold, and a wedding band, which [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]] returned
* They went to see [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Madame Mystica\|Madame Mystica]], a fortune teller and diviner who Erastus said could help with [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]]'s lycanthropy
* They bribed their way past the line and Erastus had a brief encounter with and angry dragonborn who said he had served under Erastus's command and to meet him at the Happy Beholder to settle the score
* They met with Madame Mystica and asked about breaking the werewolf curse, she read the fates and said Wrenn's "sire" was the Prime Werewolf himself, the original and most powerful werewolf
* The curse could only be broken by killing their sire or by destroying an item close to his heart and using the ashes to feed a *Remove Curse* spell
* He lives out in the lunar wastes and is a terrifying ancient werewolf hermit
* Wrenn saw through Madame Mystica's illusion so she could talk plainly with them without the theatrics
* Rip and Aired had their fortunes read
	* Aired drew *Jester* and *Void*, which foretold him failing and making terible mistakes from stupid decisions from being drunk, but he would die happy
	* Rip drew *Gem* and *Void*, which foretold how he might die from keeping a jealous secret, but Rip rejected this fortune
* They went to Buti's Beautiful Booty, a huge magical item emporium in a massive ship in the market where [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]] and Wrenn bought a *Spell Storing Ring*, a *Wild Magic Ring*, and a pair of *Glorious Holes* and traded in their cursed *Ring of Cold Resistance*
* They went back to the ship to see [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Void\|Void]] who told them the repairs to the ship would be done in one day and that he sold off the Psurlon's books to pay for the repairs and had 250GP left over for them
* They planned to set off in search of the Prime Werewolf to cure Wrenn, starting with the Mercane Agency for possibly bounty hunters and brothels for werewolves in disguise
* Erastus was fired from his job as captain of the Treasure Barge and was summoned to see the nobles of [[Places/Arnesport\|Arnesport]] for his involvement with the dragon
