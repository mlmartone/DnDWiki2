### Session 29
*Seedtime 9*
- After resting the party gathered their gear and got ready to leave [[Places/The Beastlands\|The Beastlands]] with [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Clarence\|Clarence]]'s blessing
- [[People/Beastlands Denizens/Trisfina\|Trisfina]] and [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]] talked about wanting to go home to visit their village together someday now that the orcs have been brought to justice
- Passed through the oaken portal and trekked back through [[Places/Faerun/The High Forest\|The High Forest]] to [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]], along the way they noticed lots of heavily armored bootprints near the town
- Arriving in Grey Hawk, they immediately saw that the town was in ruins, about half of the houses were burned down or crushed, others had signs of forced entry
- [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/The Bursting Barrel\|The Bursting Barrel]] was missing most of the top floor and the area around the door was plastered with posters of crudely-drawn townsfolk who were missing
- The party found their posters and pulled them down and searched through the rest for loved ones
- Near the bridge they ran into Suki on guard duty, she was surprised to see the party alive and well and she filled them in on what happened in the Battle of Grey Hawk
	- The villagers who holed up in [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Ogdin's Overlook\|Ogdin's Overlook]] fared the best, and the fishing village was empty and spared most of the fighting as a result
	- The others who hid in the [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Reeve's Manor\|Reeve's Manor]] were safe until the ground forces invaded and the ill-equipped town guard had to hold them back, most of the guards died or went missing that night
	- [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Orbital Strike\|Orbital Strike]] and [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin's Horde\|Ogdin's Horde]] managed to bring down the worm monsters then focused on driving off the alien troops, but the collateral damage was immense, [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Gabriella Starsyx\|Gabriella Starsyx]]'s magic was indiscriminate in destroying alien ships and houses alike
	- Ogdin's Horde had burned their dead and moved on to the north, likely toward Mirabar
	- [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]]'s paladins were pivotal in defending the town and since the fight they've been camped out on [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]]'s ranch not letting anyone near the crashed ship
	- The Bursting Barrel was being used as an infirmary for treating the wounded and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Reeve Fona Goldcrest\|Reeve Fona Goldcrest]] has been very altruistic in letting the homeless stay in her manor and orchestrating free meals, but she left town yesterday saying that she hasn't been able to access her credit since the robbery of the manor
	- Suki also thanked Nira for the mittens she was wearing
- Continuing through town they saw that the Reeve's Manor still stood but the grounds were destroyed, [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Geshtai's Chapel\|Geshtai's Chapel]] was missing it's doors, and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Tam Thunderhand\|Tam Thunderhand]] was hard at work crafting arms and armor so that the townsfolk wouldn't be caught unprepared in a battle again
- [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] checked in with Tam and he seemed to be doing well, happy to be doing work that mattered again but impatient for them to get back to work apprenticing at the forge
- At Nira's ranch a haughty paladin named Commandant Bradley stopped them from entering an orderly arranged encampment, but [[People/Player Characters/Feannag MacDamhan\|Feannag MacDamhan]] intimidated him to let them past
- Next they met Gabriella who was happy to see them (but still rude to Nira and hot for Feannag) and she mentioned that Alduin has been a pain lately and wont let her investigate the ship
- Nira stormed past guards into her house where Alduin and [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Hubert Mugwort\|Hubert Mugwort]] were busy doing reports and administration work, they were surprised to see her so soon and wanted the Astral Orb immediately
- Feannag lied and said they didn't have the orb, but would surrender it when the paladins agreed to leave Grey Hawk
- Alduin apologized for coopting Nira's house and agreed to move his encampment to [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Foke Barnswaggle\|Foke Barnswaggle]]'s farm, but insisted that they would need to remain in town for weeks or months to conclude their investigation and cleanse the area of extraplanar influence
- He mentioned the Mindwitness was still in the ship and that he wanted to destroy it but Gabriella was making him transport it to Neverwinter for academic study, the caravan with containment equipment would arrive in 3-6 weeks
- He seemed satisfied when the party agreed to get him the orb at a meeting at noon if he would agree to leave as soon as possible
- Outside the party discussed what to do about Alduin, the orb, the ship, and the Mindwitness
- [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Void\|Void]] overheard their conversation and joined in, excited to see them and asked for their help in convincing Alduin to let him talk to the Mindwitness
- They explained that it was a beholder infected with a mindflayer tadpole, but that it could be controlled and would be an invaluable source of knowledge of the enemy's plans
- The party let ship that they had been popping in and out of existence since they got the orb, Nira even demonstrated and Void got visibly nervous, mentioning something about having to "tell the council about this development"
- Nira went to see her flock, of which 88 sheep were left and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Zuri Xibloes\|Zuri Xibloes]] had been carefully looking after them, but in Nira's absence she had started to shear them and donate the wool to make blankets and clothing for the newly homeless in town with [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Greta Goldcrest\|Greta Goldcrest]]'s help
- Nira said Sukis mittens were substandard and Zuri seemed upset (she had only been knitting for 3 days!) but apologized and beamed when given some praise
- Going back into town they ran into [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Simon Sais\|Simon Sais]] who was in a great mood, he said his wife and newborn were healthy and they were blessed by the gods to have only a two-week pregnancy and to have survived the battle while [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Iwana Sais\|Iwana Sais]] was in labor
- Curious about this development they followed him home to see the child, who seemed to be maturing rapidly and *Detect Magic* showed that it was shrouded in illusion magic
- They then went to the market to buy gems and spell components from a shifty travelling merchant who clearly couldn't read the mood of the destroyed town
### Session 30
*Seedtime 9*
- Went to the [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Reeve's Manor\|Reeve's Manor]] to talk to [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bailey Fanteaser\|Bailey Fanteaser]], but were stopped by Perce Pewtercrest outside, who was guarding despite a clearly injured leg
- Bailey seemed super coordinated and put together, he was on top of everything and they even noticed him managing to accidentally foil [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Goop\|Goop]]'s mischief while he served stew to the villagers
- He said that he was running from the ships when he got abducted during the battle, but insisted that their worms were instead "celestials" and that the aliens were "super nice beings of pure light" who politely questioned him then returned him to the town but he couldn't remember most of it and seemed confused how he made it to shore when the dumped him in the river and he couldn't swim well
- [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]] tried to *Detect Magic* but Perce stopped him and they got into a big shouting match, and when he did cast it didn't see any magic around Bailey
- Next they went to check on [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/'Greasy' Greg Gremble\|'Greasy' Greg Gremble]] who had been holed up in his hut since the attack, fearing letting shapeshifters in
- They convinced him to let them in and struck a deal for access to mind-shielding potions if they could get him the Mindwitness's fluids
- These potions are highly experimental but he wants to be there to witness the results of the test
- The party planned for their meeting with [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Orbital Strike\|Orbital Strike]] and went to meet them at the [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Crescent's Rest\|Crescent's Rest]], where [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]], [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Gabriella Starsyx\|Gabriella Starsyx]], [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Void\|Void]], and Perce were waiting
- They convinced Alduin that Greg has been protecting them from alien influence and that they have potions to safely approach the Mindwitness
- Got him to agree to let them talk to it before they decide if it needs to be killed
- Perce argued that it should be destroyed immediately but he was overruled
- Alongside Gabriella and Void they also convinced Alduin to let them try to repair the ship so it could be used to take the Mindwitness away from Grey Hawk
- Void revealed that they are from the same plane as the shapeshifters and that their family had been killed by the same type of aliens
- Alduin asked for the Astral Orb and [[People/Player Characters/Feannag MacDamhan\|Feannag MacDamhan]] tried to retrieve it, but it was missing from his pack
- Insisting that they had it, Cock demonstrated the ability to blink out of existence, appearing in the demiplane for a few seconds and shooting off his gun once for fun
- Gabriella was super excited with academic theories, but thought the party must have attuned to the orb somehow to get this behavior
- She questioned how they had grown so powerful so quickly over the last few weeks and theorized that the orb was granting them power by proximity
- Alduin made to arrest them and told them he would need to take them to headquarters to do experiments and observe them, the party was not pleased to hear this
### Session 31
*Seedtime 9*
- Continuing their meeting with [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Orbital Strike\|Orbital Strike]], the party tried to convince [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]] that they truly didn't know where the orb was, despite the fact that [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]] had it
- [[People/Player Characters/Feannag MacDamhan\|Feannag MacDamhan]] and [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]] blinked out of existence, deepening his suspicions
- They mentioned [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bailey Fanteaser\|Bailey Fanteaser]] had been abducted and Alduin sent [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Hubert Mugwort\|Hubert Mugwort]] to go deal with that, they overhead something about a "quarantine"
- As Alduin continued to get more frustrated he made to arrest the party but Void convinced him to hold off until after the Mindwitness was dealt with
- [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/'Greasy' Greg Gremble\|'Greasy' Greg Gremble]] was eavesdropping on the meeting and walked in, clearly wasn't on great terms with Alduin
- They mentioned [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Iwana Sais\|Iwana Sais]]'s baby and Alduin seemed even more flustered but it wasn't his first priority
- The group went to the ship and Gabriella lowered the wards
- [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] and Cock took Greg's experimental mind-shielding elixir before they boarded, the entire party along with Gabriella and Perce went along
- Greg took samples from the Thri-Kreen bodies that were decomposing on the ship
- Everyone who wasn't mind-shielded heard the mindwitness's voice in their heads asking for its master
- Cock and [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]] went to get the helm of the ship from the evidence locker, Nira also gathered some personal effects that had been impounded there
- Cock suddenly began to recall his previous life, starting with fighting an urge to shoot Alduin and to kill [[People/Commandant Bradley\|Commandant Bradley]]
- On the ship Perce got impatient and decided to go in alone to see the Mindwitness despite Nira's successful persuasion
- After a moment the rest followed, onboard they saw the mess of cargo and a toppled bookshelf, each party member searched through it: [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]] found some books on Faerun etiquette and Kenku, Cock was drawn to a treatise on the Shadowfell and a book on the royal bloodlines of the Sword Coast, Nira couldn't find any books on dragons or the moon, and [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] found the manual on the operation of the ship
- They followed Perce to the room with the Mindwitness where it seemed to accept Gabriella as its new master and they fed it the alien heads while Greg collected its saliva
- They began to question it, hearing about the "Grand Scheme" and the Nine-Tongued Worm which would be using the Astral Orb as a "conduit" to enter the world
- It said the Astral Orb had been "imprinted" on by six entities and that they shall be made "perfect" in 3-4 "cycles" which was the highest honor to be chosen by the Worm
- Wrenn suddenly fell ill from the effects of Greg's experimental elixir, shedding their armor and sprouting an eyestalk over their shoulder that started blasting stunning rays at the party
- After a moment they vomited up the potion and the eyestack shriveled and fell off, which Greg collected along with the potion to "reuse"
- Speaking to the Mindwitness it said that "all of our agents on the Kiba System are in place for the Grand Scheme" and that soon the next phase would start
- It then predicted the arrival of two more imprinted members and said farewell to Wrenn
