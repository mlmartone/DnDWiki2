### Session 45
*Ship's Log 4 (Arnesport Morning)*
* After the fight where [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] cemented their beastial powers [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Taln Wolfheart\|Taln Wolfheart]] invited the party to join him in his abode at the top of the [[Places/Sapling of Yggdrasil\|Sapling of Yggdrasil]] along with some of his best fighters to plan a special mission
* They travelled up the trunk and into his lavishly decorated penthouse full of hedonistic and half-dressed attendants
* They met Taln, a bugbear pirate named Khonk, and a goliath named [[Yugin\|Yugin]] and discussed how to board and take down [[People/Arnesport Citizens/The Dealer\|The Dealer]]'s flagship
* Taln was being a bit cagey around the plan and [[People/Player Characters/Erastus Wyndhoek\|Erastus Wyndhoek]] didn't trust him, but they agreed to a deal where the party would take [[People/Player Characters/Sea Bastion\|Sea Bastion]] and Taln would send a second strike force on another ship while [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Cap'n Flameskull\|Cap'n Flameskull]]'s assault distracted the fleet, would leave in 20 hours
* [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]] used his penetrating vision to see through a blanket hiding a massive weapon in the mold of his own cursed gun, but much larger, which Yugin was hiding
* Yugin said he had somewhere important to be in an hour and left, the party declined Taln's invitation to stay and enjoy themselves and instead tailed Yugin
* They saw Yugin, who was not a very smart or discreet person, wave at [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Thunivel\|Thunivel]], then stop to chat with some others who, like him, carried Black Saint guns and didn't seem to have the animal features of everyone else in the tree
* While Yugin was distracted watchin more of the bloodsport, the party demanded to enter the off-limits backstage area by claiming Taln had sent them
* Inside they passed through the portal to [[Places/The Beastlands\|The Beastlands]] where they were hailed from [[People/Beastlands Denizens/The Vile Hunt\|The Vile Hunt]]'s fort as if they were here to help
* Instead they said they were here to hunt the girl and walked straight to the jungle treeline where they met up with [[People/Beastlands Denizens/Trisfina\|Trisfina]] and [[People/Beastlands Denizens/Romper\|Romper]],
* After catching up they made a plan to bring back Trisfina as if she were dead then take out the fort from the inside, so they bloodied her up and put her on a stretcher while Romper stood by
* They walked back to the fort claiming to have easily hunted the elf, they were let in, then told to help place the body on the wall as a grotesque warning to others
* [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]] was injured so he went to the fort's infirmary where he ran into the hunter they had allowed to escape, who recognized him immediately
* Outside Wrenn and Erastus were convincing the hunter that they had found and killed Trisfina when they were told that someone else had arrived at the fort just before they returned
* Wrenn felt a gun to their back and heard [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Thunivel\|Thunivel]]'s mirthless laugh as he asked what they were doing here
### Session 46
*Ship's Log 4 (Arnesport Morning)*
* In [[People/Beastlands Denizens/The Vile Hunt\|The Vile Hunt]]'s fort in [[Places/The Beastlands\|The Beastlands]] [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] tried to escape [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Thunivel\|Thunivel]] but he shot them grievously in the back before dropping his gun from their *Heat Metal* spell
