### Session 51
*Ship's Log 5 (Arnesport Late Morning)*
* The party dragged [[People/Player Characters/Feannag MacDamhan\|Feannag MacDamhan]]'s body out of the catacombs and up through the [[Places/Sapling of Yggdrasil\|Sapling of Yggdrasil]], past all of [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Taln Wolfheart\|Taln Wolfheart]]'s crew, to their ship to be preserved
* There they were still upset over the death of their friend so they callously told [[People/Faerun Denizens/Orbital Strike/Void\|Void]] that [[People/Faerun Denizens/Orbital Strike/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]] was dead and Feannag had killed him, which they didn't take well
* From their vantage on the tree bough they could see [[Places/Arnesport\|Arnesport]] was in chaos, ships were attacking buildings and fighting each other in the skies
* They boarded and flew over to the Bowsprit where they were scheduled to meet with the [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Council of Pirate Lords\|Council of Pirate Lords]] to go over the details of their plan to take down [[People/Arnesport Citizens/The Dealer\|The Dealer]]
* On the way a hostile ship from [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Sticky-Fingers McGee\|Sticky-Fingers McGee]]'s fleet approached and fired on them, but [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]] returned fire, destroying their only weapon with a well-placed shot and forcing them to break off the assault
* In the council room tensions were already running high, but [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Lord Tarly Wyndhoek\|Lord Tarly Wyndhoek]] was particularly inhospitable to [[People/Player Characters/Erastus Wyndhoek\|Erastus Wyndhoek]] and his crew, who gave him the silent treatment in return
* [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Amber Arnes\|Amber Arnes]], Taln, [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Cap'n Flameskull\|Cap'n Flameskull]], and Tarly discussed the strategy of how to bring the city to order and take out the Dealer
* They agreed to use Flameskull's ships as a diversion to allow Taln to be "captured" and the party to sneak aboard by running the blockade
* Amber and Tarly set about bringing order to the city, but the party was able to convince The Lioness to provide some supplies to their ship for the mission, so she provided a crate of pirate grog, a favorite for getting injured crew back into the battle with side effects that only show up later
* Outside the chamber they decided to leave Void, who was still recovering from the attack, and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/The Garlicle\|The Garlicle]] behind in [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Large Luigi\|Large Luigi]]'s tavern but to take the [[People/Astral Denizens/Mindwitness\|Mindwitness]] along
* After a long chat with the Garlicle they learned he could tell the future if they tasted his special sauce, and some had their fortunes read
* Outside a massive fleet of skeleton ships rose up from the lake where they had been submerged, then sail up and directly into the blockade
* Taln's ship took off and the party saw him toast to them with a glass then disappear when he took a sip
* They waited for a few minutes for the battle to get underway, then flew up and looked for an opening in the blockade line, which was now in complete chaos as the skeleton ships battled fiercely
* However the Dealer seemed to have a fleet of all-metal ships that were immensely more capable than any other Spelljamming vessels seen before, and one was able to break off from the fight to chase down [[People/Player Characters/Sea Bastion\|Sea Bastion]]
* A dogfight ensued, and the party was unable to outrun the faster ship so they turned to fight, using the *Arcane Magnifier* to *Heat Metal* and cook the crew at the helm of the ship
* The battle started well but as soon as the ship got a clean broadside the heavy cannon fire ripped through the rickety wooden ship, dealing heavy damage to everyone onboard
* In a desperate last stand the party grappled the ship with the jaws and boarded to neutralize the cannons and make the battle hand-to-hand combat
### Session 52
*Ship's Log 5 (Arnesport Late Morning)*
* [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]] used the momentum of ramming [[People/Arnesport Citizens/The Dealer\|The Dealer]]'s turtle ship to launch himself aboard and start layout out pirates left and right with the help of [[People/Player Characters/Erastus Wyndhoek\|Erastus Wyndhoek]], [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]], and [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Redley\|Redley]]
* [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]] continued to pilot [[People/Player Characters/Sea Bastion\|Sea Bastion]] while [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] concentrated on *Heat Metal* to flush the opposing crew out of their cover
* They managed to fight off the dastardly, charming pirates who emerged, then went below decks where they were accosted by spellcasters, [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Velma The Vulture\|Velma The Vulture]], a [Shield Guardian](https://5e.tools/bestiary/shield-guardian-xmm.html), and more well-equipped crew
* Meanwhile [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]], Rip, and Wrenn realized there was an invisible counter-boarding party approaching from under their own ship and a fierce battle broke out
* Nira was able to get away from the fighting and *Polymorph* a guard and slip past a spellcaster so she could explore the metal ship, where she found chests overflowing with gold, magic items, and other unimaginable wealth
* As Aired dropped the enemy first mate he was unable to stop the pirate from detonating an entire necklace of fireballs which killed several pirates and knocked most of the party unconscious
* The boarders took out Rip from stealth, but he was pulled into the orb before he was killed outright, then they advanced on Cock and Wrenn
* Just as they seemed to be holding their own the unaccounted-for caster appeared and attacked from behind, knocking out Cock and *Counterspelling* Wrenn's attempts to heal him
* In the other ship Erastus, Redley, and Aired were able to take down the Shield Guardian, but the captain was too much for them, able to push through near-mortal wounds to fight them all off with vicious swordplay and riposting all attacks with multiplied power, even taking the sudden appearance of Rip in stride
* After a brief chase Redley got caught as well and the entire party found themselves defeated by the crew of Velma the Vulture
* The last thing they heard as their weapons were taken, their hands were bound, and their pockets were looted was the captain saying that the best loot was always in the *Bag of Holding*
### Session 53
*Ship's Log 5 (Arnesport Late Morning)*
* As the party lay defeated in front of the remnant of [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Velma The Vulture\|Velma The Vulture]]'s crew, she took their gear and opened the *Bag of Colding* looking for more loot
* Immediately a vortex of swirling cold fog poured out and filled the room as the bag floated out of her hands and above everyone's head and the Djinn's voice could be heard laughing
* The vortex suddenly reversed, pulling the party, [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Redley\|Redley]], Velma, and two of her crew into the bag where the Djinn loomed large over all of them trapped on a platform in the middle of a void with their stored items floating about around them larger than life
* After a brief self-aggrandizing speech about taking vengeance on those who trapped him (though he claimed he was never truly trapped), it became clear that the Djinn couldn't tell the humanoids apart, but he only wanted to punish the five who trapped him
* The party set about deceiving and persuading the Djinn that Velma and the pirates were the ones he was after
* Redley quickly cleared his name with persuasion (and looking quite a bit different as a Loxodon)
* [[People/Player Characters/Erastus Wyndhoek\|Erastus Wyndhoek]] played to the Djinn's arrogance with flattery, just as he had with the dragon
* [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]] offered to help free him from his bonds to [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Reeve Fona Goldcrest\|Reeve Fona Goldcrest]], which got her freed, though she couldn't convince him to bring [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] and [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]] along
* The pirates foolishly misread the situation and bound themselves all together as a group, threatening the Djinn if they weren't released, putting them on thin ice
* [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]] took advantage of the pirates misstep and sacrificed himself by admitting to be one of the Djinn's captors, but also implicating the pirates with him
* Rip admitted to knowing the Reeve but, but the Djinn made him swear a binding oath that the first action he took once freed would be to help take down the Reeve
* [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]] tried to use his *Echo Avatar* to escape but the Djinn offered him a chance to save himself by playing the last pirate in a game of chance, which he won
* Wrenn couldn't convince the Djinn to free them so they were implicated along with Cock and the three pirates
* The Djinn said the five of them would spend eternity serving him in his mansion in the *Plane of Elemental Air*, but after he took care of one last issue
* He still owed one wish before he was freed of his servitude, which he granted to the "innocent" bystanders as recompense for dragging them into this
* He then twisted the deal with Rip to make them be the one to make the wish, forcing the wish to actually be to the Djinn's benefit
* After discussing briefly, they decided to *Wish* for *Resurrection* of [[People/Player Characters/Feannag MacDamhan\|Feannag MacDamhan]] back in [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]] along with a weapon and a note telling him to kill the Reeve
* Finally freed, the Djinn teleported everyone to his mansion, an opulent study full of trinkets and games, but before he sent away the freed party members Cock and Wrenn appealed to the Djinn's arrogance, wagering their secrets against their freedom
* Cock faced the Djinn in a complex game of strategy, but while he was distracted the rest of the party spread out around the study to look for clues how to help him outsmart this immensely intelligent and powerful immortal being
* The Djinn was in the process of besting Cock when the rest of the party solved a series of puzzles that granted him key advantages in the game, which leveled the scales and allowed him to hold off the ticking clock
* This gave the party enough time to solve riddles that revealed the magic ring that binds the Djinn along with his true hidden name, [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Amroq\|Amroq]]
* Just as Nira put on the ring and claimed power over Amroq, Cock bested him at the game, securing his and Wrenn's freedom (but leaving the pirates behind)
* The Djinn's demeanor suddenly changed at the prospect of mortals besting him and binding him again just as he had escaped his last master, and he offered to grant them any *Wish* in exchange for the ring
* They used the wish to restore themselves and Redley to full health and cure their ailments from the fight while restoring some magical abilities
* Amroq then took the pirates deeper into his mansion and with a snap sent the party safely back out of the *Bag of Colding* and into darkness
