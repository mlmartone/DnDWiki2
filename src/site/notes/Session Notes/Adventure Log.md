### Session 20
*Seedtime 5*
- The party snuck up to the [[Places/Reeve's Manor\|Reeve's Manor]] while [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Reeve Fona Goldcrest\|Reeve Fona Goldcrest]] was out meeting with [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]]
- Inside they saw the Reeve's reclusive husband, [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Lambert Portier\|Lambert Portier]] drinking heavily
- [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]] used *Alter Self* to take on the appearance of the Reeve, [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] used *Disguise Self* to look like [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bitts Goldcrest\|Bitts Goldcrest]], an after [[People/Player Characters/Feannag MacDamhan\|Feannag MacDamhan]] picked the lock they walked right in the front door
- Nira was able to fool the servants with her disguise, sending them on errands to get them out of the way while Wrenn got the window open to let the rest of the party sneak in and get upstairs
- While digging around in other rooms Wrenn came across another servant as well as a glyph protecting the room of the Reeve's son
- In the Reeve's bedroom the party investigated for clues, [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]] used *Detect Magic* to find some potions of sleep, some enchanted prayer beads, and eventually came across a key to the study where the book was waiting
- The party used the key to get into the study, but found that all magic was suppressed in the room, their spells, disguises, and magic items ceased to function
- In the study [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]] suddenly was overwhelmed with memories as the fog in his mind cleared, seeing visions of his past and recalling his real name
- Lambert drunkenly stumbled up the stairs and right into the bedroom where Nira was waiting disguised as the Reeve
- She tried to put him to sleep but he was suspicious and a bit belligerent, he then tried to get her to dance, which he was very skilled at though Nira had never done royal ballroom dances before
- He pulled her downstairs and had the servants start playing music as they attempted to dance
- The rest of the party used the opportunity to search the study, finding the drawer and ledger within, which Cock swapped with a book of similar weight to avoid setting off a trap mechanism
- When he took the book an opal ring fell to the ground, and when he touched it a Djinni appeared
- When the group couldn't produce evidence that they were members of the Reeve's family it attacked, saying that it was bound to protect the home of its master
- Seeing the fight break out and with the knowledge that the book was in hand Wrenn cast *Silence* to cover the noise while Feannag began to escape, using a ladder he had stashed along the balcony last night to make a getaway
- The Djinni was attacking viscously, but Cock managed to get the ring into the *Bag of Colding*, though it didn't function inside the antimagic field and he was caught in a whirlwind it had summoned
- Together Cock, Rip, Aired, and Wrenn managed to get the bag out of the room, which sucked the Djinni into the pocket dimension once the enchantment functioned again, but not before it downed Cock
- Meanwhile Nira used *Prestidigitation* to escape the advances of Lambert, walking out the front door along in disguise
- Feannag had made it to the street by this point and saw the real Reeve returning, so he made a scene of calling her out for stiffing them on their reward in front of the whole town, unjustly locking [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bailey Fanteaser\|Bailey Fanteaser]] up, and for acting rude and like she was better than the rest of the town
- He, with Rip's help, managed to whip up a small mob and force her to retreat with her guards back to the manor
- Back in the study Cock and Wrenn cleaned up the evidence and made a complete mess of the room before fleeing
- Each party member found their own way out of the heist, Nira through disguise as [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Nora Gremble\|Nora Gremble]], Aired through drunken tomfoolery with the real Nora's aid, Cock through *Invisibility*, Feannag through stealth, Wrenn through disguise as Bitts, and Rip by pretending to be delivering the mail
- Out on the street the mob had begun to rouse, and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Simon Sais\|Simon Sais]] broke his brother-in-law Bailey out of the stocks as the party regrouped and Aired dropped the stolen key in the river
### Session 19
*Seedtime 4-5*
- [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]] helped [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Dutch 'The Boozer King' Ottenbrau\|Dutch 'The Boozer King' Ottenbrau]] out at [[Places/The Bursting Barrel\|The Bursting Barrel]], but it was starting to run out of beer and food without [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Gerthwin Bartelby\|Gerthwin Bartelby]] looking after the books
- After [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]] collected the dead wizard's spellbook, the party went back to town and met up with Aired and went to the fishing village
- The guards at the docks pointed them to the customs house where [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Greta Goldcrest\|Greta Goldcrest]] was able to help Aired sort out Gerthwin's shipping orders to get food and ale back into the tavern
- She was sympathetic to the party and apologized for her sister's outburst, her daughter [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bitts Goldcrest\|Bitts Goldcrest]] was interested in apprenticing with Nira
- Talked to [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Yarr Xibloes\|Yarr Xibloes]] who also was sympathetic to [[People/Player Characters/Feannag MacDamhan\|Feannag MacDamhan]]'s call for town unity without the limits imposed by the Reeve, gave them a fish to serve at the tavern tonight
- Back at The Bursting Barrel they tried to decipher Gerthwin's ledgers but they were too cryptic and disorganized, they then followed up with [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Nora Gremble\|Nora Gremble]] who said she would be re-shoeing the Reeve's horse tonight
- Out behind the tavern they summoned [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Goop\|Goop]] with some shiny trinkets, which it traded for an interesting bell that rings 10 seconds after it was rung
- Goop was happy to hear that [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bailey Fanteaser\|Bailey Fanteaser]] was in trouble and that [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Reeve Fona Goldcrest\|Reeve Fona Goldcrest]] was upset, but didn't seem too sure about the hag being truly gone, and wanted nothing to do with her magic items
- It seemed to be interested in the Reeve's "shiny book treasure" which it couldn't steal because its magic didn't work on the upper floors of the [[Places/Reeve's Manor\|Reeve's Manor]]
- The party agreed to steal this book for Goop if it would plant the stolen 500GP where Greta might find it
- Before carrying out the heist on the manor they cased the joint and regrouped
- Long Rest
- In the morning Rip went to deliver the mail and spoke to Ginia, the Reeve's haughty servant, but wasn't able to get a read on their schedule
- Aired went stealthing around the guard's quarters and overheard [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]] questioning the shapeshifter
- The Reeve left her house to go have a meeting with Alduin, and the party kicked off their heist plans
### Session 18
*Seedtime 4*
- Started out in the aftermath of the fight to capture the shapeshifter
- Negotiated for half the reward with [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin The Anvil\|Ogdin The Anvil]] and got 1500GP early from [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]]
- Alduin and [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Gabriella Starsyx\|Gabriella Starsyx]] took the shifter away and imprisoned it for questioning, Gabriella seemed to have a bit of a crush on [[People/Player Characters/Feannag MacDamhan\|Feannag MacDamhan]]
- The party went back to Ogdin and split the reward money with him
- Went to the [[Places/Reeve's Manor\|Reeve's Manor]] to collect the reward that [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bailey Fanteaser\|Bailey Fanteaser]] lost for returning [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bitts Goldcrest\|Bitts Goldcrest]]
- A guard met them and informed them that they wouldn't be able to pay out the reward in gold right now, so the party could pick 5 items from [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Reeve Fona Goldcrest\|Reeve Fona Goldcrest]]'s jewelry collection or one of her horses as compensation
- He went to a wall safe and took out a lockbox that contained a ruby-encrusted tiara, an opal ring, a pearl necklace, and various precious metal bracelets, the party looked them over and then tried to haggle unsuccessfully with the guard
- They went across the street to the [[Places/Crescent's Rest\|Crescent's Rest]] where the Reeve was finishing up a meal, she was cordial at first but after Feannag started pointing out the limits of her power in the town and haggling poorly over the reward money she tossed 15GP at their feet and told them that's all the reward they would get
- The party went to a town guard on bridge duty named Bartholomew, whom they asked about the guards' salaries and toll collection duties and probed their loyalties to the Reeve
- They also talked to the other guard on duty, Phillip, who seemed open to taking bribes to let them free Bailey from the stocks
- Feannag was somewhat successful in getting both bridge guards to abandon their loyalties to the Reeve and join some sort of union or uprising in the town
- As they were talking to the guards the more perceptive members of the party heard a shout of surprise and looked up to see two humanoid figures flying in the sky above the town as they were zapped by the anti-flight wards Gabriella had put up and went hurtling down into the edge of [[Places/The High Forest\|The High Forest]]
- Entering the forest to investigate they found two craters, one with the broken body of a Drow Wizard still in it
- They collected his spellbook, dagger, magical armor, and papers which seemed to bear the mark of [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]]'s gun Pi'za along with a picture of his face and map to [[Places/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]]
- Cock, wanting to power up his weapon tried to shoot the corpse, but though Pi'za seemed amused by the grizzly gesture nothing happened
- At that moment a gigantic lightning-fueled golem appeared and began ruthlessly attacking Cock (and when he hid it targeted [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]]) with its dual arm cannons
- The party managed to defeat the [Fluxcharger](https://5e.tools/bestiary/fluxcharger-ggr.html) with a few key critical hits and weathered its lightning-storm death throes, then collected its *Lightning Core* and *Primordial Dust*, which Pi'za seemed eager to consume
- Short Rest
