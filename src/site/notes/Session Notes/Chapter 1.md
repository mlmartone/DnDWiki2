### **Small Town Troubles**
The fledgling adventuring party learns about their new powers and abilities as [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Orbital Strike\|Orbital Strike]] begins searching the town for the Astral Orb.  The party looked into a poisoned well, which led them to work with local alchemist [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/'Greasy' Greg Gremble\|'Greasy' Greg Gremble]] (first by helping him "milk" a Shambling Mound), then they found out there was a mermaid secretly living in the lake who instructed them to go destroy a Grung spawning pool upstream.  Meanwhile the party looked into the strange happenings around Nora's free-roaming horse named [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Clarence\|Clarence]], specifically how he seemed to disappear into a tree in [[Places/Faerun/The High Forest\|The High Forest]].  They also tracked down a Boggle named [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Goop\|Goop]], who returned their stolen items.  [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Reka Rearguard\|Reka Rearguard]] was murdered and the party staked out to find a zombie pounding on [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Iwana Sais\|Iwana Sais]]'s door, which they destroyed, revealing a ghost of her mother who said that her daughter was in great danger.  
### Session 2
*Greenwake 41*
- Aired tried out his new brewer's kit but the bottle exploded
- Feannag and Nira discussed how to keep the sheep safe in the future
- A town meeting was called, led by [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]] and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Reeve Fona Goldcrest\|Reeve Fona Goldcrest]], announcing that there was likely a shapeshifter in their midst.  The shapeshifter is dangerous and can assume anyone's form, so villagers should travel in groups of three for safety.  An investigation was being conducted to track down the shapeshifter.  Tony's Pajamas were found behind [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/The Bursting Barrel\|The Bursting Barrel]], so he was likely the shapeshifter and has taken on a new form
- [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Simon Sais\|Simon Sais]] spoke up at the meeting, saying there was a banging and scratching at his door around 3am last night
- Wrenn spoke up, concerned they were the shapeshifter after their magical lightning outburst the night before
- Nira pulled [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Gabriella Starsyx\|Gabriella Starsyx]] aside for a quick discussion of her fledgling magical abilities, though somewhat rude Gabriella was able to give her some pointers, Rip also followed along and both gained a modicum of control over simple spells
- Wrenn met with their mentor [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Tam Thunderhand\|Tam Thunderhand]], who revealed that he was a forge cleric adventurer before he settled in [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]], they worked together to forge a +1 shield and they learned to control a small amount of divine magic over a few hours of training montage
- Feannag talked with [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Foke Barnswaggle\|Foke Barnswaggle]], who mentioned the well by his house seems poisoned and also heard tales of a mermaid in the lake from some local fishermen, Feannag blames the Reeve
- Took a sample of water from the suspicious well and Aired analyzed it with his brewer's kit, decided to bring it to the expert: [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/'Greasy' Greg Gremble\|'Greasy' Greg Gremble]]
- Greg was in the middle of trying to "milk" the fluids of a [Shambling Mound](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17011-shambling-mound), a powerful plant monster of the High Forest.  The party helped him collect 3/5 spiles of fluid and escape the mound, but not before Wrenn and Aired dropped to 0HP
### Session 3
*Greenwake 41-42*
- Short rest at [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/'Greasy' Greg Gremble\|'Greasy' Greg Gremble]]'s house while he used his alchemy equipment to analyze the well water, was able to distill a black curse fluid out of the water, which Aired took.  He also mentioned it could be from something evil or poisonous living in the water and contaminating it.  
- Greg also mentioned that he was working on Lightning Resistance Potions with the Shambling Mound fluid and that they should bring interesting fluids to him for trade in the future
- Went to [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/The Bursting Barrel\|The Bursting Barrel]] and spoke with [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Nora Gremble\|Nora Gremble]], [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Gerthwin Bartelby\|Gerthwin Bartelby]], and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Dutch 'The Boozer King' Ottenbrau\|Dutch 'The Boozer King' Ottenbrau]], while Nora was feeding [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Clarence\|Clarence]], who seemed to have miraculously healed from his injuries the night before
- Went to the docks of the fishing village, met [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Yarr Xibloes\|Yarr Xibloes]] who offered to take them out to look for the mermaid in the morning
- Went back to The Bursting Barrel where Tony's Pajamas were found, [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Void\|Void]] was already there, they described the danger of the shapeshifter and how they'd been tracking it for over a year since it's kind wiped out their village somewhere among the stars
- Long Rest
- Woke up early and went out with Yarr to find the mermaid by the waterfall
- [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Saoirse\|Saoirse]] introduced herself, said she'd been living in the lake for years but the poison was ruining the water, must be coming from a village of poisonous Grung upriver spawning in the waters
- For some reason they then threatened Yarr and gaslit him into believing they didn't find a mermaid
- On their way back through town they saw a crowd around [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Simon Sais\|Simon Sais]] and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Iwana Sais\|Iwana Sais]]'s house, upon further inspection they found [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Reka Rearguard\|Reka Rearguard]] dead, clearly killed sometime in the middle of the night and found in the morning.  She had blunt trauma and a nasty bite taken out of her side, then she likely bled out.  She had a shovel with her.  
- Feannag interviewed Simon, he said he heard the banging on his door again and a scream around 3am.  Investigation cut short when town guards arrived and took over.  
- Trekked into [[Places/Faerun/The High Forest\|The High Forest]] along the [[Places/Faerun/Dessarin River\|Dessarin River]] for about 2 hours, found some Grung in the shallows of the river guarding a spawning pool full of tadpoles.  The [Grung](https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/monstres.php?vo=grung) tried to chase them away, fired a warning shot and the party attacked and killed all but one who fled and went for backup.  
- While the air filled with the sounds of Grung in the trees the party considered whether or not to destroy the spawning pool and the ~300 tadpoles in it.  Nira blasted the pool with Sacred Flame before they fled
- Aired took a sample of Orange Grung Poison
### Session 4
*Greenwake 42*
- Party discussed moral implications of destroying Grung spawning pool
- While about 2 miles north of town a small figure appeared and stole Wrenn's 100gp pearl
- The party chased but it escaped all grapples with slippery oil on its skin and using small dimensional rifts to flee.  Party opted not to chase into [[Places/Faerun/The High Forest\|The High Forest]]
- Saw [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Clarence\|Clarence]] walking around in the forest, Nira called him over and fed him some hay then they all went back to town
- Back in town they saw the villagers queueing up to go into a small booth set up with a magical aura around it
- Feannag snuck up to it and overheard [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]] interviewing villagers one-by-one for info on the shapeshifter.  He was using Zone of Truth to get secrets out of people, and guards were marking off names from the book when they had been vetted by Alduin
- Aired went in for an interrogation, passed easily, Cock went in and was detained for not being able to answer truthfully due to his failed memory
- Nira was able to vouch for him to get him free of the guard's quarters
- Feannag and Wrenn had no interest in being interrogated, wanted to sneak away and avoid Alduin
- Feannag stealthily tracked [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bailey Fanteaser\|Bailey Fanteaser]] back to his house with the book of names, then stole the book, crossed his own name off, and left the book on Bailey's porch
- Went to see [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/'Greasy' Greg Gremble\|'Greasy' Greg Gremble]] who was able to identify the slippery and sticky goo they collected from the goblinoid thief as coming from a Boggle, a bogeyman chaotic evil fey who use trickery and thievery to cause mischief and steal shiny trinkets
- Sold Orange Grung poison to Greg, who examined it and said it had nothing to do with the poisoning of the water supply, suggested the cursed fluid could be from some sort of evil fey in the area
- Party set about gathering shiny trinkets to try to catch the Boggle in a trap behind [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/The Bursting Barrel\|The Bursting Barrel]], Feannag bought stuff from the market and Wrenn polished up steel armor scraps from [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Tam's Forge and Blacksmith Shop\|Tam's Forge and Blacksmith Shop]]
- Managed to catch the Boggle, who answered questions in exchange for shiny "treasures"
- It's name is [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Goop\|Goop]], and it lives under Bailey's house and fucks with him constantly.  Traded trinkets for Wrenn's pearl and a small magic item.  Goop also mentioned that the vile liquid smelled like "her," some mysterious mistress who hurt it before.  
- Rip cast Alarm on [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Simon Sais\|Simon Sais]]'s door to try to catch the culprit of the banging
### Session 5
*Greenwake 42*
- After discussing how to set a trap to catch whatever was banging on Simon and Iwana's door, the party followed [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Clarence\|Clarence]] on his midnight trot into the woods
- Though he spotted them and ran away, they were able to track him to a clearing with a huge ancient oak tree
- The group was spotted by a group of territorial [boars](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16812-boar), which attacked, dropping Rip to 0HP, but they were easily dispatched by the group.  Aired opted to knock them unconscious rather than kill the beasts.  Rip started a small forest fire
- Feannag noticed Clarence run behind the oak with a green flash, and after chasing him he saw the tree closing up some sort of magical doorway.  Upon further inspection Aired noticed some druidic runes carved into the roots
- After managing to put out the forest fire, the party returned to camp following Nira's skein of yarn she'd laid down on the way out
- Short rest in Rip's nest
- Feannag set up a stakeout across from [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Simon Sais\|Simon Sais]] and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Iwana Sais\|Iwana Sais]]'s house, saw a figure approach and bang on the door in the dark.  The rest of the party arrived and Wrenn recognized the zombie as Cima Fanteaser, Iwana's mother
- After banging on the door unsuccessfully for a few minutes the zombie shambled off down the road to the graveyard followed by the party
- Nira, Rip, and Cock kept it distracted with mage hands while Feannag and Aired ran to the Crescent's Rest to get help from Alduin
- Alduin quickly dispatched the [zombie](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17077-zombie), and a [specter](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17017-specter) rose out of the body, which the party and Void quickly subdued
- Finally calmed, the spirit of Cima was able to communicate that her daughter was in danger, she was pregnant and the baby was some sort of monster.  She said she was sorry and was finally at peace
- Alduin commented on how the group seemed like a budding new adventuring party, Nira disagreed wholeheartedly.  He said they should look into this matter in the town since Orbital Strike was looking for the shapeshifter and didn't have time.  
- Feannag went to the graveyard and buried the body, everyone else went home to sleep as the sun rose
- Long Rest
- Level Up! (1->2)
