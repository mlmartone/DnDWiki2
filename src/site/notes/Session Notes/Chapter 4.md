### **The Battle for Grey Hawk**
The fate of the small town of [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]] is decided in a series of confrontations within the town and by invaders.  Another assassin tries to claim [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]]'s life and weapon.  The party tries to collect the reward for the return of the children but it has gone missing, so the party decides to overthrow [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Reeve Fona Goldcrest\|Reeve Fona Goldcrest]]'s limited aristocracy in the town.  They recruit the help of [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Goop\|Goop]], who asks that they plan a daring heist into the [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Reeve's Manor\|Reeve's Manor]] to steal her ledger in return.  In the process of escaping the manor they accidentally capture a powerful Djinni in the *Bag of Colding*, get [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Nora Gremble\|Nora Gremble]] blamed for the breakin, and start an open revolt against the Reeve by the townsfolk.  [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Clarence\|Clarence]] has been wounded again, and after investigating the party finds that [[People/Faerun Denizens/Ogdin's Horde/Grund Razorclaw\|Grund Razorclaw]]'s orcs have likely entered the Beastlands through the tree portal.  Back in town there is chaos as the guard's quarters is burned down by a disgruntled [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/'Greasy' Greg Gremble\|'Greasy' Greg Gremble]], allowing the shapeshifter to escape.  They finally track down the Astral Orb, but just as the [[People/Astral Denizens/Serax-Dral\|Serax-Dral]]'s alien ships arrive along with reinforcements and gargantuan flying worm monsters.  A huge battle ensues and the party is brought aboard an alien flying vessel where they fight off the crew and are forced to crash-land to protect [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]]'s flock.  After saving as many villagers as possible the party takes the Astral Orb and flees to the Beastlands with alien ships hot in pursuit.  
### Session 18
*Seedtime 4*
- Started out in the aftermath of the fight to capture the shapeshifter
- Negotiated for half the reward with [[People/Faerun Denizens/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin The Anvil\|Ogdin The Anvil]] and got 1500GP early from [[People/Faerun Denizens/Orbital Strike/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]]
- Alduin and [[People/Faerun Denizens/Orbital Strike/Gabriella Starsyx\|Gabriella Starsyx]] took the shifter away and imprisoned it for questioning, Gabriella seemed to have a bit of a crush on [[People/Player Characters/Feannag MacDamhan\|Feannag MacDamhan]]
- The party went back to Ogdin and split the reward money with him
- Went to the [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Reeve's Manor\|Reeve's Manor]] to collect the reward that [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bailey Fanteaser\|Bailey Fanteaser]] lost for returning [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bitts Goldcrest\|Bitts Goldcrest]]
- A guard met them and informed them that they wouldn't be able to pay out the reward in gold right now, so the party could pick 5 items from [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Reeve Fona Goldcrest\|Reeve Fona Goldcrest]]'s jewelry collection or one of her horses as compensation
- He went to a wall safe and took out a lockbox that contained a ruby-encrusted tiara, an opal ring, a pearl necklace, and various precious metal bracelets, the party looked them over and then tried to haggle unsuccessfully with the guard
- They went across the street to the [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Crescent's Rest\|Crescent's Rest]] where the Reeve was finishing up a meal, she was cordial at first but after Feannag started pointing out the limits of her power in the town and haggling poorly over the reward money she tossed 15GP at their feet and told them that's all the reward they would get
- The party went to a town guard on bridge duty named Bartholomew, whom they asked about the guards' salaries and toll collection duties and probed their loyalties to the Reeve
- They also talked to the other guard on duty, Phillip, who seemed open to taking bribes to let them free Bailey from the stocks
- Feannag was somewhat successful in getting both bridge guards to abandon their loyalties to the Reeve and join some sort of union or uprising in the town
- As they were talking to the guards the more perceptive members of the party heard a shout of surprise and looked up to see two humanoid figures flying in the sky above the town as they were zapped by the anti-flight wards Gabriella had put up and went hurtling down into the edge of [[Places/Faerun/The High Forest\|The High Forest]]
- Entering the forest to investigate they found two craters, one with the broken body of a Drow Wizard still in it
- They collected his spellbook, dagger, magical armor, and papers which seemed to bear the mark of [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]]'s gun Pi'za along with a picture of his face and map to [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]]
- Cock, wanting to power up his weapon tried to shoot the corpse, but though Pi'za seemed amused by the grizzly gesture nothing happened
- At that moment a gigantic lightning-fueled golem appeared and began ruthlessly attacking Cock (and when he hid it targeted [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]]) with its dual arm cannons
- The party managed to defeat the [Fluxcharger](https://5e.tools/bestiary/fluxcharger-ggr.html) with a few key critical hits and weathered its lightning-storm death throes, then collected its *Lightning Core* and *Primordial Dust*, which Pi'za seemed eager to consume
- Short Rest
### Session 19
*Seedtime 4-5*
- [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]] helped [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Dutch 'The Boozer King' Ottenbrau\|Dutch 'The Boozer King' Ottenbrau]] out at [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/The Bursting Barrel\|The Bursting Barrel]], but it was starting to run out of beer and food without [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Gerthwin Bartelby\|Gerthwin Bartelby]] looking after the books
- After [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]] collected the dead wizard's spellbook, the party went back to town and met up with Aired and went to the fishing village
- The guards at the docks pointed them to the customs house where [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Greta Goldcrest\|Greta Goldcrest]] was able to help Aired sort out Gerthwin's shipping orders to get food and ale back into the tavern
- She was sympathetic to the party and apologized for her sister's outburst, her daughter [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bitts Goldcrest\|Bitts Goldcrest]] was interested in apprenticing with Nira
- Talked to [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Yarr Xibloes\|Yarr Xibloes]] who also was sympathetic to [[People/Player Characters/Feannag MacDamhan\|Feannag MacDamhan]]'s call for town unity without the limits imposed by the Reeve, gave them a fish to serve at the tavern tonight
- Back at The Bursting Barrel they tried to decipher Gerthwin's ledgers but they were too cryptic and disorganized, they then followed up with [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Nora Gremble\|Nora Gremble]] who said she would be re-shoeing the Reeve's horse tonight
- Out behind the tavern they summoned [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Goop\|Goop]] with some shiny trinkets, which it traded for an interesting bell that rings 10 seconds after it was rung
- Goop was happy to hear that [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bailey Fanteaser\|Bailey Fanteaser]] was in trouble and that [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Reeve Fona Goldcrest\|Reeve Fona Goldcrest]] was upset, but didn't seem too sure about the hag being truly gone, and wanted nothing to do with her magic items
- It seemed to be interested in the Reeve's "shiny book treasure" which it couldn't steal because its magic didn't work on the upper floors of the [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Reeve's Manor\|Reeve's Manor]]
- The party agreed to steal this book for Goop if it would plant the stolen 500GP where Greta might find it
- Before carrying out the heist on the manor they cased the joint and regrouped
- Long Rest
- In the morning Rip went to deliver the mail and spoke to Ginia, the Reeve's haughty servant, but wasn't able to get a read on their schedule
- Aired went stealthing around the guard's quarters and overheard [[People/Faerun Denizens/Orbital Strike/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]] questioning the shapeshifter
- The Reeve left her house to go have a meeting with Alduin, and the party kicked off their heist plans
### Session 20
*Seedtime 5*
- The party snuck up to the [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Reeve's Manor\|Reeve's Manor]] while [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Reeve Fona Goldcrest\|Reeve Fona Goldcrest]] was out meeting with [[People/Faerun Denizens/Orbital Strike/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]]
- Inside they saw the Reeve's reclusive husband, [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Lambert Portier\|Lambert Portier]] drinking heavily
- [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]] used *Alter Self* to take on the appearance of the Reeve, [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] used *Disguise Self* to look like [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bitts Goldcrest\|Bitts Goldcrest]], an after [[People/Player Characters/Feannag MacDamhan\|Feannag MacDamhan]] picked the lock they walked right in the front door
- Nira was able to fool the servants with her disguise, sending them on errands to get them out of the way while Wrenn got the window open to let the rest of the party sneak in and get upstairs
- While digging around in other rooms Wrenn came across another servant as well as a glyph protecting the room of the Reeve's son
- In the Reeve's bedroom the party investigated for clues, [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]] used *Detect Magic* to find some potions of sleep, some enchanted prayer beads, and eventually came across a key to the study where the book was waiting
- The party used the key to get into the study, but found that all magic was suppressed in the room, their spells, disguises, and magic items ceased to function
- In the study [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]] suddenly was overwhelmed with memories as the fog in his mind cleared, seeing visions of his past and recalling his real name
- Lambert drunkenly stumbled up the stairs and right into the bedroom where Nira was waiting disguised as the Reeve
- She tried to put him to sleep but he was suspicious and a bit belligerent, he then tried to get her to dance, which he was very skilled at though Nira had never done royal ballroom dances before
- He pulled her downstairs and had the servants start playing music as they attempted to dance
- The rest of the party used the opportunity to search the study, finding the drawer and ledger within, which Cock swapped with a book of similar weight to avoid setting off a trap mechanism
- When he took the book an opal ring fell to the ground, and when he touched it a Djinni appeared
- When the group couldn't produce evidence that they were members of the Reeve's family it attacked, saying that it was bound to protect the home of its master
- Seeing the fight break out and with the knowledge that the book was in hand Wrenn cast *Silence* to cover the noise while Feannag began to escape, using a ladder he had stashed along the balcony last night to make a getaway
- The Djinni was attacking viscously, but Cock managed to get the ring into the *Bag of Colding*, though it didn't function inside the antimagic field and he was caught in a whirlwind it had summoned
- Together Cock, Rip, Aired, and Wrenn managed to get the bag out of the room, which sucked the Djinni into the pocket dimension once the enchantment functioned again, but not before it downed Cock
- Meanwhile Nira used *Prestidigitation* to escape the advances of Lambert, walking out the front door alone in disguise
- Feannag had made it to the street by this point and saw the real Reeve returning, so he made a scene of calling her out for stiffing them on their reward in front of the whole town, unjustly locking [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bailey Fanteaser\|Bailey Fanteaser]] up, and for acting rude and like she was better than the rest of the town
- He, with Rip's help, managed to whip up a small mob and force her to retreat with her guards back to the manor
- Back in the study Cock and Wrenn cleaned up the evidence and made a complete mess of the room before fleeing
- Each party member found their own way out of the heist, Nira through disguise as [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Nora Gremble\|Nora Gremble]], Aired through drunken tomfoolery with the real Nora's aid, Cock through *Invisibility*, Feannag through stealth, Wrenn through disguise as Bitts, and Rip by pretending to be delivering the mail
- Out on the street the mob had begun to rouse, and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Simon Sais\|Simon Sais]] broke his brother-in-law Bailey out of the stocks as the party regrouped and Aired dropped the stolen key in the river
### Session 21
*Seedtime 5*
- Outside the [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Reeve's Manor\|Reeve's Manor]] a mob was starting to form, whipped up by [[People/Player Characters/Feannag MacDamhan\|Feannag MacDamhan]]'s comments to [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Reeve Fona Goldcrest\|Reeve Fona Goldcrest]]
- Feannag tried to calm things down before they got too out of hand but failed to persuade them
- Meanwhile [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]] went with [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Nora Gremble\|Nora Gremble]] to the stables where they found a bloody injured [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Clarence\|Clarence]]
- Aired ran to get the rest of the group and on the way back they ran into [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Goop\|Goop]], who asked for the book they stole, they were able to skim it to see business ledgers and bank accounts but Goop began destroying it before they could extract useful information
- In return Goop gave them a magic hat and disappeared to plant the 500GP it stole in the [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Crescent's Rest\|Crescent's Rest]]
- Meanwhile they heard an angry shriek from the Reeve's Manor, likely indicating the Reeve had found the evidence of the robbery
- [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] healed Clarence and calmed Nora down, and they investigated the wounds and saw claw and tooth marks and a bloody trail leading back into [[Places/Faerun/The High Forest\|The High Forest]]
- Short Rest
- In [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/The Bursting Barrel\|The Bursting Barrel]] they talked to [[People/Faerun Denizens/Ogdin's Horde/Gudbrand the Elder\|Gudbrand the Elder]] who was mad at [[People/Faerun Denizens/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin The Anvil\|Ogdin The Anvil]] for pushing him aside in favor of Harie, who turned out to be the shapeshifter in disguise
- Nora got arrested by the guards for being present at the Reeve's manor at the time of the heist and the party let the guards take her away as they headed off into the forest to find out what happened to Clarence
- Along the way found a wolf fang with a silver filling in the blood trail, remembered that [[People/Faerun Denizens/Ogdin's Horde/Grund Razorclaw\|Grund Razorclaw]]'s crew of orc druids had some silver teeth between them
- They tracked the blood to the Beastlands portal and staked it out for a few hours before giving up and going back to town, finding some invisiberries on the way
- Near town they could smell smoke and hear alarm bells and ran in to see the guard's quarter's ablaze, townsfolk were rushing to the river to bring buckets to douse the flames
- They noticed the only one walking nonchalantly away from the fire was [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/'Greasy' Greg Gremble\|'Greasy' Greg Gremble]], and when they confronted him he seemed to indicate that he was mad that his sister had been arrested
- Aired and Feannag coated themselves in flame retardant and ran into the burning building, inside they saw no sign of the shapeshifter other than empty chains and the body of one of the paladin guards, which Feannag recovered
- Aired stumbled across [[People/Faerun Denizens/Orbital Strike/Void\|Void]] who was wracked with visions and was crying out "They are coming" as they crawled through the flames, Aired was able to drag them out the front of the building
- [[People/Faerun Denizens/Orbital Strike/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]] burst through a wall with the final survivors on his back, causing the burning wing of the building to finally collapse
- Outside they could see that Void's black clothing was in tatters and his mask was gone, revealing jet black skin, pointy elven ears, black eyes with pupils like stars, and silvery hair that seemed untouched by the flames
- They left Alduin to heal the survivors, but confirmed that the shapeshifter was missing along with the body of one of Alduin's paladin captains
- They headed over to the anti-flight wards and Feannag put on the charm to get some information and help from [[People/Faerun Denizens/Orbital Strike/Gabriella Starsyx\|Gabriella Starsyx]]
- They then went back to the Bursting Barrel and helped Gudbrand and Ogdin reconcile, though Ogdin couldn't remember large chunks of the last few days
- Gudbrand mentioned something about Ogdin burying something and they raced off to the [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Graveyard\|Graveyard]] to investigate
- With Ogdin's help they dug up a grave and found the orb sitting there in a busted open casket
- Swirling star patterns danced across the surface and the party were able to resist its pull, though Ogdin was entranced by it and seemed bewitched before collapsing
- [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]] teleported him away from the orb but it didn't seem to help so Feannag and Aired dashed off to get help from Gabriella and Alduin
- Gabriella started tending to Ogdin with a complex ritual spell while Alduin set to collecting the orb in some sort of special bag
- Suddenly gravity shifted again, waves emanating out from the wards by the falls that made everyone briefly float in the air before slamming back down to the ground
- The party ran over to check the wards and there they saw the missing paladin captain with his sword jammed through the carved runes, looking satisfied with a smug smile on his face
- He introduced himself as [[People/Astral Denizens/Serax-Dral\|Serax-Dral]], and thanked the party for making the last few weeks fun for him as he killed and infiltrated his way through [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]], [[People/Faerun Denizens/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin's Horde\|Ogdin's Horde]], and finally Alduin's Paladins
- He said that they were too late and as much as he would love to taste each of their flesh individually, he had a ship to catch, gesturing upward as three massive flying ships came into view, alongside three gargantuan worms undulating through the air
- Serax-Dral said he would even give them all a free shot to show them how insignificant they truly were, and the party leapt into action
- The party dealt several heavy hits and soon he was coughing up blood, cursing the weakness of his human form before reversing gravity to send all of them up onto the ship hovering overhead
- Onboard they saw two more wormlike aliens like the shifter's true form along with a host of armed insectoid aliens, and a fight broke out
- Meanwhile the worms descended upon the town, crushing buildings and attacking the largest population centers: The Bursting Barrel, The Fishing Village, and Nira's Ranch
- Alduin appeared flying on a winged steed and asked them which to save first, and the party sent him off to the fishing village while Ogdin, cured from his stupor and using it to fuel his rage took on the worm that attacked the Bursting Barrel
- The party began fighting through the alien ranks until [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]] blasted one of the aliens off the ship, leaving the helm unpiloted and sending most of the party overboard while the ship began an uncontrolled descent
- [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]] used *Feather Fall* to stop the plummeting party and Serax-Dral summoned a worm to catch him midair
- Cock and Aired managed to stay onboard and dispatched the remaining aliens and tried to physically control the falling ship by pulling on the wings, sending it towards the worm attacking Nira's sheep
- Wrenn and Nira managed to get the helm working and steered the ship into the worm, closing the jaws to take a huge chunk out of the gigantic worm's side
- Feannag took a parting shot at Serax-Dral, knocking him off the worm and watching him plummet down to the ground
- The ship careened into the worm and the whole party tumbled off the vessel and scattered onto the ground amidst the terrified herd of sheep
- Looking upward they saw the other two ships beginning to close in on Grey Hawk
### Session 22
*Seedtime 5*
- [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]] came to consciousness with her dog licking her face as she and the rest of the party lay amidst the rubble of the barn and ship
- The party could see [[People/Faerun Denizens/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin's Horde\|Ogdin's Horde]] volleying javelins at one worm while [[People/Faerun Denizens/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin The Anvil\|Ogdin The Anvil]] himself flew through the air to strike it with his warhammer
- Over [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Grey Hawk Falls\|Grey Hawk Falls]] [[People/Faerun Denizens/Orbital Strike/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]] atop his pegasus steed and [[People/Faerun Denizens/Orbital Strike/Void\|Void]] battled the other worm midair
- Suddenly everyone felt the slimy tendrils of an alien mind touch their consciousnesses, which began to relay orders to get the Astral Orb and bring in reinforcements
- [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]] used Skywrite to warn their allies of the descending ships before the party took off to the fishing village to look for survivors
- They managed to gather 18 townsfolk and took them in a mad dash across the open field to try to get to the cover of the caves under [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Ogdin's Overlook\|Ogdin's Overlook]]
- A worm broke away from the fighting, enticed by the easy prey of the villagers, but the party managed to slow it down; Nira using her staff as it was technically domesticated, [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]] casting spells, and [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]]+Cock ran a distraction
- [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] and [[People/Player Characters/Feannag MacDamhan\|Feannag MacDamhan]] led the survivors to the caves and grabbed some of Ogdin's barbarians to look after them while the party rushed into town to help
- Most of the villagers had been taken into the basement of the [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Reeve's Manor\|Reeve's Manor]] and Perce wasn't receptive to the party's attempt to get them to a safer location
- [[People/Faerun Denizens/Orbital Strike/Orbital Strike\|Orbital Strike]] met in the town square after driving off the worms, then decided they would have to fight off the ships but wanted the Astral Orb safely away from [[Places/Faerun/Grey Hawk/Grey Hawk\|Grey Hawk]]
- Asked the party to take it to where the ships couldn't follow, but warned them not to look directly into it
- [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Clarence\|Clarence]] and [[People/Faerun Denizens/Ogdin's Horde/Gudbrand the Elder\|Gudbrand the Elder]] appeared and the party considered whether to flee to the Beastlands or the Underdark
- They decided to flee with Clarence into the [[Places/Faerun/The High Forest\|The High Forest]] with the help of [[People/Faerun Denizens/Orbital Strike/Gabriella Starsyx\|Gabriella Starsyx]]'s hastening magic as the rest of the defenders regrouped before the ships arrived
- They were halfway to the portal when an entire tree was uprooted in front of them by an alien ship hovering overhead
- Dodging beams and ballista bolts the party fled through the forest and across the field where Clarence led them through the portal into the Beastlands where they were greeted by blinding sunlight of midday
- Clarence finally spoke, introducing himself as a petitioner and a native of the Beastlands, then admonished the party for leading [[People/Faerun Denizens/Ogdin's Horde/Grund Razorclaw\|Grund Razorclaw]] and his orcs into this land
- Across the savannah littered with animal corpses at the edge of a dense rainforest the party could see smoke rising from a ramshakle fort covered in sharpened stakes with animal skulls atop
- Clarence offered them a chance to amend their wrongs by clearing out the orcs, but warned that with the wild power of the Beastlands the orcs were much more powerful than when they were in the Material Plane
- He warned them that there was only one civilized settlement to the south, but it was full of evil people, but a ranger in the forest named Trisfina might be able to help
- Exhausted, the party trudged through the dense underbrush and came across a small cluster of ground nests around a climbable tree
- Up in the tree they finally rested
- Long Rest
- Level Up (4->5)
