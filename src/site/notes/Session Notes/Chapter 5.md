The party explores the animal paradise of the Beastlands and finally puts down Grund Razorclaw and his band of orcs.  
### Session 23
*Beastlands, Day 1 (unknown date)*
- The party woke up in the tree in [[Places/The Beastlands\|The Beastlands]] to find [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]] missing, but his gear and bedroll were still there
- Breathing the damp jungle air the party felt wildly alive and connected to nature, everyone but [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] embraced this feeling
- As they descended the tree they saw a baby gorilla eating termites off of a stick being manipulated with *Mage Hand*
- When [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]] approached he spooked it and an adult [ape](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16788-ape?srsltid=AfmBOorTyvMHJTawHQplJJK64AywT6PsaJNutKmmA6Hok3EjJkObUL34) ran in to defend it
- Defending themselves the party injured the gorilla, then a ten-foot-tall [giant ape](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Giant%20Ape#content) appeared and clashed with the party, using spells as well as its colossal strength to fight
- Wrenn killed an ape and [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]] finally wrestled the giant beast to the ground with a chokehold
- As they subdued the ape a huge grey monster rushed Aired down and defended the unconscious gorilla
- A small elven woman stepped into the clearing, revealing herself as her chameleon-like skin shifted into view, holding an ornate bow aimed at the group
- Locking eyes with Aired, she lowered her weapon and called out to him, introducing herself as Trisfina, the sister of Aired's friend who died in the village assault years ago
- She explained that she had fled the village during the orcish assault led by [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Grund Razorclaw\|Grund Razorclaw]] several decades ago, and was pursued by orcs until she hid inside a glowing tree, which turned out to be the same portal to the Beastlands the party had just used
- With tensions somewhat diffused the party lowered their weapons and the giant ape righted himself and complimented Aired on his wrestling skills, then introduced himself as Duuza, a petitioner like [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Clarence\|Clarence]]
- Duuza was leader of the gorilla tribe, and had attacked when he saw Cock's gun, which resembled the weapons used by the Vile Hunt, an evil organization that has been killing all of the talking animals in the Beastlands
- Trisfina introduced her companion, the Grey Render known as Romper, who had been a trained hunting animal of the Vile Hunt before she helped him escape
- Duuza and Trisfina offered the party help in getting back to the Material Plane if they did something to dislodge the Vile Hunt from their camp to the south
- When the party mentioned Clarence and the fact that the very orcs that killed Trisfina's sister were here in the Beastlands, she pledged to help Aired bring them to justice
- Wrenn found themselves overcome with a strange feeling, they dropped to their knuckles and found thick black fur sprouting from their arms as they began to transform into a gorilla, a curse imparted by the Beastlands on anyone who slays an animal here
- In a solemn ceremony Wrenn ate some of the dead gorilla's flesh, indicating that the kill had not just been for sport but as part of a hunt for survival, and the natural curse began to dissolve, allowing them to revert to their gnomish form
- Romper gobbled up the rest of the corpse in a single bite, showing his terrifying maw but enjoying belly rubs from Trisfina afterwards
### Session 24
*Beastlands, Day 1 (unknown date)*
- The party went with [[People/Beastlands Denizens/Trisfina\|Trisfina]] to scout out the orc's fort from a tall tree nearby
- Watched as the orcs performed inhuman feats of strength to clearcut the forest near their fort, clearly their power had grown upon reaching [[Places/The Beastlands\|The Beastlands]]
- [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]] attempted to crawn out through the savanna to track two orcs that were dragging a captured lioness back to their fort
- He was spotted and the two orcs, one with large horns and the other with massive claws, attacked him with new physical and magical abilities, and he was narrowly able to escape with his life
- The party strategized how to attack the fort and [[People/Player Characters/Feannag MacDamhan\|Feannag MacDamhan]] had the idea to smoke them out with some sort of stink bomb
- Trisfina informed them about magically-enhanced skunks in the forest to the north where they might be able to harvest components for these bombs, but told them not to cross the river under any circumstances
- They ventured up into the forest and found the skunk burrows, then flushed them out of the dens with the Endless Decanter
- Fought and killed the skunks after being sprayed with various effects
- Successfully harvested three glands and made bombs out of them
- Short Rest
