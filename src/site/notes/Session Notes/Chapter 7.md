### **The Heart of a Wolf**
Bereft of her draconic power [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]] was consumed by the power of the [[Kiba System/Astral Orb\|Astral Orb]] and became an aberrant abomination, growing tentacles and doing battle with her companions inside the orb.  Upon her defeat she was reborn as a Lunar Sorcerer using the collapsed moon within the orb as the source of her power, but not before [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] was bitten and cursed with lycanthropy.  The party blipped back to [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Selunius\|Selunius]]'s lair, which was empty save signs of bloody struggle so they fled on the Treasure Barge back to [[Places/Arnesport\|Arnesport]] where they learned that [[People/Player Characters/Erastus Wyndhoek\|Erastus Wyndhoek]], a newly minted Paladin of Selunius had been raised to a seat on the [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Council of Pirate Lords\|Council of Pirate Lords]] by decree of the dragon against the will of the council members.  After getting their fortunes told by [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Madame Mystica\|Madame Mystica]] and learning how to break the curse the party set off to hunt the Prime Werewolf, an elf named [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Sulumor\|Sulumor]] who [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]] had freed from Selunius's cult.  With the help of [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Moolissa\|Moolissa]], a contract hunter from the Mercane Agency, they tracked and killed Sulumor, taking the *Heart of the Prime Werewolf*.  Meanwhile Erastus attended his first council meeting where the weakened council argued about how to handle the blockade set up by [[People/Arnesport Citizens/The Dealer\|The Dealer]] around Arnesport.  He made the acquaintance of a young captain named [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Taln Wolfheart\|Taln Wolfheart]] who had a daring plan to destroy the Dealer's ship from within.  The party's ship, the [[People/Player Characters/Sea Bastion\|Sea Bastion]], was finally repaired and outfitted for Spelljamming.  Not satisfied with their purchased magical goods and weapons, Nira stole an Arcane Magnifier for the ship, which caused them to be attacked by [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Cap'n Flameskull\|Cap'n Flameskull]]'s crew and [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Haus Wexler\|Haus Wexler]]'s automatons.  They took refuge in Taln's headquarters, the [[Places/Sapling of Yggdrasil\|Sapling of Yggdrasil]], where they saw evidence of the Black Saints and felt the pull of [[Places/The Beastlands\|The Beastlands]].  After exploring the tree and chasing a suspicious man named [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Worms\|Worms]] through a portal they rested and squeezed the pirate crew for intel.  They saw an opportunity to prove their combat prowess to Taln in a bloodsport where Wrenn was able to harness control of their lycanthrope form and gain permanent control over their transformation by consuming the *Heart of the Prime Werewolf*.  
### Session 38
*Ship's Log 1 (Arnesport Sunrise)*
- [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]]'s form began to bulge and writhe as it transformed, her chains breaking as tentacles sprouted from her back and she chanted in Deep Speech with a voice that was not her own
- The Astral Orb hovered right above her, spinning faster and faster as she drew power from it and became an Eldritch Aberrant version of herself
- As people tried to grab her suddenly everyone nearby was sucked into the orb including the party, [[People/Player Characters/Erastus Wyndhoek\|Erastus Wyndhoek]], [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Anihala\|Anihala]], [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Algarjax\|Algarjax]], and two of [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Selunius\|Selunius]]'s werewolf guards
- A fight ensued on the broken chunks of the moon that splintered across the void in the orb, Nira using her new powers to lash out with tentacles, summon aberrations, and deal tremendous psychic damage to the party with her screams
- The werewolves continued in their bloodlust to attack the party, [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] dealt with them but only after being bitten and cursed with lycanthropy themself
- As Nira was about to kill [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]] he blasted her with his gun, sending her spinning backwards through space where a random stray bullet that had been whizzing around in the orb struck her and sent her into the crevasses of the fractured moon
- A moment later there was a radiant burst of light from the moon as it began to reform violently, chunks of rock spinning around and crashing into the surface as gravity pulled the pieces together and formed a new, whole moon once more
- Nira the Lunar Sorceress was reborn, stronger and with this new moon in the orb as her source of Lunar power, she rejected the eldritch power that had taken hold and managed to bind it into a crystalline shard that empowered her spells
- Everyone was ejected from the orb except Nira and back into Selunius's lair, a few hours had passed and there was no sign of the dragon nor her cultists
- Back in the main chamber a grisly scene was laid out before the party: blood and viscera smeared over the walls and floor, countless cultist bodies torn apart by fangs and claws with bloody tracks leading out the door and into the lunar wastes
- [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] and Cock looted the cultists for armor and money, but as they boarded the ship Wrenn entered the moonlight and began to transform into a werewolf, bloodlust filling their eyes as they lunged for their friends in a frenzy
- [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]] subdued them and they were wrapped in a blanket to be hidden from the moonlight where they returned to gnomish form
- The group crossed the lunar wastes back to [[Places/Arnesport\|Arnesport]] without trouble, but wondering what had become of Nira in the orb
### Session 39
*Ship's Log 2 (Arnesport Morning)*
* Upon docking in [[Places/Arnesport\|Arnesport]] [[People/Player Characters/Erastus Wyndhoek\|Erastus Wyndhoek]] was verbally assaulted by a guard at the dock who called him a traitor and said [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Selunius\|Selunius]] had visited the city to inform them that he was now her champion and to put him on the council to speak for her
* [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]] picked the guard's pocket as he left, got his gloves, gold, and a wedding band, which [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]] returned
* They went to see [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Madame Mystica\|Madame Mystica]], a fortune teller and diviner who Erastus said could help with [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]]'s lycanthropy
* They bribed their way past the line and Erastus had a brief encounter with and angry dragonborn who said he had served under Erastus's command and to meet him at the Happy Beholder to settle the score
* They met with Madame Mystica and asked about breaking the werewolf curse, she read the fates and said Wrenn's "sire" was the Prime Werewolf himself, the original and most powerful werewolf
* The curse could only be broken by killing their sire or by destroying an item close to his heart and using the ashes to feed a *Remove Curse* spell
* He lives out in the lunar wastes and is a terrifying ancient werewolf hermit
* Wrenn saw through Madame Mystica's illusion so she could talk plainly with them without the theatrics
* Rip and Aired had their fortunes read
	* Aired drew *Jester* and *Void*, which foretold him failing and making terible mistakes from stupid decisions from being drunk, but he would die happy
	* Rip drew *Gem* and *Void*, which foretold how he might die from keeping a jealous secret, but Rip rejected this fortune
* They went to Buti's Beautiful Booty, a huge magical item emporium in a massive ship in the market where [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]] and Wrenn bought a *Spell Storing Ring*, a *Wild Magic Ring*, and a pair of *Glorious Holes* and traded in their cursed *Ring of Cold Resistance*
* They went back to the ship to see [[People/Faerun Denizens/Orbital Strike/Void\|Void]] who told them the repairs to the ship would be done in one day and that he sold off the Psurlon's books to pay for the repairs and had 250GP left over for them
* They planned to set off in search of the Prime Werewolf to cure Wrenn, starting with the Mercane Agency for possibly bounty hunters and brothels for werewolves in disguise
* Erastus was fired from his job as captain of the Treasure Barge and was summoned to see the nobles of [[Places/Arnesport\|Arnesport]] for his involvement with the dragon
### Session 40
*Ship's Log 2 (Arnesport Morning)*
* The party without [[People/Player Characters/Erastus Wyndhoek\|Erastus Wyndhoek]] went to The Bilge where they found a pristine building marked as *The Mercane Agency of Arnesport*
* Spoke to a bespectacled gnome in a very open, clean, and sparsely decorated lobby area
* He offered them entry into the agency as workers or contract labor, though they tried to use Erastus's name to sweeten the deal
* Sealed the contract with a gigantic Mercane who said he would remember them
* Paid 400gp for the *Werewolf Extermination Package* which came with silver swords and the help of a minotaur hunter named [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Moolissa\|Moolissa]]
* Borrowed the Treasure Barge with [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Anihala\|Anihala]] and [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Algarjax\|Algarjax]] and set out for 4 hours across the lunar wastes following Moolissa's directions
* Arrived at a cave with lots of footprints indicating traffic in and out, some armored some slippered, evidence of [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Selunius\|Selunius]]'s cult
* Lots of signs around the cave mouth warned of danger and to turn back or else "the beast" might hurt you
* In a cavernous room with hovering tiles over a deep pit the party traced out words in the glyphs to cross safely, just in time as the ceiling of the cave collapsed
* On the other side of the cavern [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]] found a threadbare sheep doll, when she touched it a faint ghostly voice of an elf girl started talking
* She said she couldn't remember her name but told them the story of how her father was a shepherd who obsessed over protecting his flock from wolves in the forest, but one day her druidic powers awoke and he shot her in wild shape
* She said that her mother had cursed her father but he was just trying to atone for his mistake
* Later the party found a locket with a picture of [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Sulumor\|Sulumor]] and the ghost girl in his den
* Just then Sulumor returned from hunting the lunar wastes and he initially thanked them for freeing him from Selunius's cult, but then things got tense when he saw they were holding the sheep doll and locket
* He took the doll back, unable to perceive the ghost of his daughter, but as he walked away [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] raised their holy symbol and channeled to *Destroy Undead*, which made the girl's spirit visible to Sulumor as she shrieked and dissipated as the doll turned to ash in his hands
* Enraged and tortured by this loss Sulumor lost control, taking the form of the Prime Werewolf and howling to summon a pack to attack the party
* They fought desperately and were able to kill Sulumor with Moolissa's help, and Wrenn cut out his heart to cure their own curse
### Session 41
*Ship's Log 2-3 (Arnesport Morning)*
* While the party was off trying to cure [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]]'s lycanthropy, [[People/Player Characters/Erastus Wyndhoek\|Erastus Wyndhoek]] was summoned to the [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Council of Pirate Lords\|Council of Pirate Lords]] to discuss the fact that the dragon had forced his elevation to council member
* He was treated as a pariah as he walked hrough the city to *The Bridge* where he was begrudgingly admitted to the opulent *tBowsprit*, the council's headquarters
* Inside he was treated with derision for not having a ship but being elevated to the Council through [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Selunius\|Selunius]]'s influence, especially from [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Lord Tarly Wyndhoek\|Lord Tarly Wyndhoek]]
* The Council of Pirate Lords was seated around a table, each with their own unique throne, but three members were conspicuously absent, all having fell victim to [[People/Arnesport Citizens/The Dealer\|The Dealer]] recently ([[People/Arnesport Citizens/Haus Wexler\|Haus Wexler]], [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Sticky-Fingers McGee\|Sticky-Fingers McGee]], and [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Deadeye Hollins\|Deadeye Hollins]])
* The council discussed how to [[Quests/Deal with The Dealer\|Deal with The Dealer]], with each captain putting forward a proposal to consider before disbanding at an impasse
	* [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Amber Arnes\|Amber Arnes]] wanted to slip past the blockade to call for allies to help
	* [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Lord Tarly Wyndhoek\|Lord Tarly Wyndhoek]] wanted to listen to the Dealer's demands to try to reason with him
	* [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Cap'n Flameskull\|Cap'n Flameskull]] as an unhinged pyromaniac wanted to engage in a full frontal assault on the Dealer's fleet
	* [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Taln Wolfheart\|Taln Wolfheart]] wanted to try a daring mission to pretend to be captured and then dismantle the Dealer's flagship from within
* Erastus was told to secure a ship before the next council meeting to be considered a captain, and also to bring his own seat to represent himself on the council
* Afterwards Taln caught up with Erastus and tried to cut him in on a plan to rob Haus Wexler's estate before he could awaken a new clone after his body was destroyed by the Dealer
* The plan was to steal a cask of fancy liquor from Wexler's personal supply, but Erastus turned him down
* Meanwhile the party returned from [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Sulumor\|Sulumor]]'s lair to [[Places/Arnesport\|Arnesport]] where they parted ways with [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Moolissa\|Moolissa]], [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Anihala\|Anihala]], and [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Algarjax\|Algarjax]]
* Long Rest at the ship
* Repairs were complete on their ship, which they christened [[People/Player Characters/Sea Bastion\|Sea Bastion]]
* Went to *Arnesport Armaments* to outfit their new ship with weapons, Erastus and [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]] talked the shopkeep into a deal on a Ballista and special ammunition
* [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]] disguised herself as an employee and managed to steal an Arcane Magnifier, an extremely expensive (and large) piece of equipment, she got it outside with the party's help and disguised it as a crate of cabbages with an illusion
### Session 42
*Ship's Log 3 (Arnesport Morning)*
* [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]] was wheeling the stolen Arcane Magnifier (disguised as a cabbage cart) through the [[Places/Arnesport\|Arnesport]] streets as the party followed behind, noticing a mechanical gargoyle fly off from the top of the store as they left
* Ahead the path was blocked by a crowd forming around two dueling skeleton pirates, and a patrol of more skeletons were closing in on the party from behind
* A veiled woman ran up to Nira and asked for her help getting away from the ruckus, directing the party down an alley then suddenly diving for the stolen goods
* [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]] puncher her and the head popped off revealing another skeleton as the patrol caught up to an engaged [[People/Player Characters/Erastus Wyndhoek\|Erastus Wyndhoek]]
* A fight broke out and as each skeleton was destroyed its skull would come to life possessed by [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Cap'n Flameskull\|Cap'n Flameskull]] and explode in a *Fireball*
* They dealt with the skeletons and Aired prevented Cap'n Flameskull from escaping by crushing the last skull with a well-aimed parting shot
* They fled through the alleys to the docks but just as they saw the [[People/Player Characters/Sea Bastion\|Sea Bastion]] in sight a massive mechanical scorpion ship landed ahead of them and attacked with brutal artillery fire
* Half the party boarded the ship to take out the crew while the rest rushed the stolen weapon towards their own ship to get it airborne
* [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]] took the helm and after failing to ram the enemy ship it returned fire with a devastating hotshot blast from its cannon
* After killing the last mechanical crewmember on deck they could see that everyone in the area was watching the fight so Cock used *Skywrite* to  say "The Dragon is Coming" as a distraction
* This prompted mass hysteria as a stampede ensued in the streets and ships began launching half-crewed only to be obliterated when they reached [[People/Arnesport Citizens/The Dealer\|The Dealer]]'s impenetrable blockade
* With the stolen Arcane Magnifier aboard Aired and [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] went belowdeck on the scorpion ship to try to commandeer the vessel in the chaos
### Session 43
*Ship's Log 3 (Arnesport Morning)*
* Still in the midst of city-wide chaos and a ship-to-ship battle the party continued to try to take down the rest of the mechanical crew inside the scorpion ship
* The captain quickly downed [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] and [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]] helped them flee just as a new ship approached from above, dropping off four beastial pirate berserkers and a strange red gas that drove everyone into a rage
* Fighting the urge to rage the party surrendered to this new force and the crew set about commandeering the ship in the name of their captain [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Taln Wolfheart\|Taln Wolfheart]]
* Taln himself was piloting the ship above and offered them a chance to join him at his treetop fortress, the [[Places/Sapling of Yggdrasil\|Sapling of Yggdrasil]], to lay low from the heat of stealing from [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Haus Wexler\|Haus Wexler]]'s shop
* As they followed Taln's ship, [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]] used his powers to see through the hull of the ship to peek at the cask of liquid they had stolen from Wexler's estate
* They landed on a wide branch of a massive tree where they were met by Taln and an entourage of beastial pirate attendants, he invited them to feast with his crew and asked [[People/Player Characters/Erastus Wyndhoek\|Erastus Wyndhoek]] to join him at the Captains' Table
* Inside the massive interior of the tree they immediately felt a primal hunger awaken within, a hunger they hadn't felt since their trip to [[Places/The Beastlands\|The Beastlands]], they soon also noticed animal features returning to their faces
* The Heart of the Prime Werewolf in Wrenn's bag began faintly beating, getting stronger as they moved into the heart of the tree
* Cock gambled with a pirate and learned about Taln's secret plan to board [[People/Arnesport Citizens/The Dealer\|The Dealer]]'s flagship to take it down from the inside with the help of some special liquor they stole from Wexler
* [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]] and Aired explored the tree and spoke to a pirate who claimed to be part of Taln's original crew back in [[Places/Faerun/Faerun\|Faerun]], he told them the story of how Taln got his start in [[Places/Arnesport\|Arnesport]] and how they grey the great tree fortress
* None of the pirates seemed to know about any connection to The Beastlands but they also said there were off-limits areas for captains only
* Wrenn was unsettled by the beating heart and returned it to the ship with [[People/Faerun Denizens/Orbital Strike/Void\|Void]] for safekeeping, while there they used the ash of [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Sulumor\|Sulumor]]'s daughter's doll as a component of *Remove Curse* to cure their lycanthropy
### Session 44
*Ship's Log 3 (Arnesport Morning)*
* [[People/Player Characters/Erastus Wyndhoek\|Erastus Wyndhoek]] followed [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Taln Wolfheart\|Taln Wolfheart]] to the Canopy of the [[Places/Sapling of Yggdrasil\|Sapling of Yggdrasil]] where many high-ranking pirate captains were socializing
* They discussed how they plan to use the stolen liquor to sneak aboard [[People/Arnesport Citizens/The Dealer\|The Dealer]]'s flagship
* Taln was eventually pulled away by a shifty, foul-smelling man with mushrooms growing up the side of his face named [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Worms\|Worms]]
* Erastus wandered over to a dangerous-looking loner captain at the edge of the room who introduced himself as [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Thunivel\|Thunivel]], Taln's "fixer"
* He mentioned that Taln had heard the Dealer had a powerful magical artifact that might be able to be turned against him if they could steal it, but that Thunivel wouldn't be going on this mission as it "wasn't his style"
* [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]] and [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]] were unable to talk their way into the Canopy, so Nira cast *Clairvoyance* to evesdrop on the captains' conversations
* She overheard Worms telling Thunivel that "the girl is being a problem" and "disrupting our operations," which she connected to [[People/Beastlands Denizens/Trisfina\|Trisfina]] and [[People/Beastlands Denizens/The Vile Hunt\|The Vile Hunt]]
* She also glimpsed that Thunivel was carrying two pistols in underarm holsters that matched the one [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]] carried
* The party regrouped and were joined by [[People/Faerun Denizens/Orbital Strike/Void\|Void]], then talked with more of the feasting pirates to get information about the tree (the Canopy is for captains only, there's a bloodsport match going on soon, the hotsprings at the base can heal you, and never go into the catacombs)
* They went down to the hotsprings for a short rest that gave them the benefits of a long rest from the magical rejuvenation
* Void caught Worms sneaking down into the catacombs and followed along with [[People/Faerun Denizens/Pointy\|Pointy]]
* Lost track of him at a three-way intersection, followed the smell of rot and decay and caught a glimpse of Worms as he disappeared into an inky black portal, but they were attacked by undead limbs grasping from the walls of the tunnel
* Void sensed another portal in the direction of the stream feeding the hotsprings
* Now rested they went to check out the bloodsport, which turned out to be a brawl between warriors who had taken on beastial forms by eating animal hearts in a bid to make their new powers permanent by drinking from a stream that was flowing from behind a bole of bark in the tree wall
* Taln was goading new challengers to join the fray, saying that those who proved themselves here would be chosen to go on a special mission soon, which the party figured might be related to the Dealer
* [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] challenged an owlbear-form barbarian to a duel alongside Erastus and Aired
* They took a bloody bite of the beating heart of the prime werewolf and transformed into a werewolf with bone ridges and extra powerful fangs and claws
* While the brawl took place Void and [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]] used the distraction as cover to sneak into the backstage area where the stream was flowing from where they found a green portal to [[Places/The Beastlands\|The Beastlands]]
* Void stepped through into The Beastlands near a clear cut section of forest and a fort bearing the symbol of The Vile Hunt, they were immediately shot with a green and white fletched arrow; the same kind Trisfina was known to use
* Wrenn barely managed to win the fight and drank from the stream to make the power permanent, allowing them to transform into a controlled lycanthrope form at will
* Taln congratulated them and invited the victorious combatants to join him for a mission briefing
