- As Nira's life was fading she saw a vision of a dragon who claimed to be her ancestor from 1000 years ago, and that she was the last living relative of a line of great lunar sorcerers, the last being Nira's great-great grandmother Midna.  The dragon invited Nira to explore her new powers and someday visit her on the moon
