## Session Notes
[[Quests/Quest List\|Quest List]]
### Session 11
*Greenwake 45-Seedtime 1*
- [[People/Player Characters/Feannag MacDamhan\|Feannag MacDamhan]] woke up in the infirmary of [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin's Horde\|Ogdin's Horde]]'s camp, snuck out to join the rest of the party as they came down from [[Places/Ogdin's Overlook\|Ogdin's Overlook]]
- The party briefly spoke to [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Gudbrand the Elder\|Gudbrand the Elder]], who congratulated them on completing the trial and told them to return tomorrow to continue the rites
- Seeing [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin The Anvil\|Ogdin The Anvil]] and [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]] readying for a fight, they convinced Ogdin to parlay to avoid a costly battle.  Together they crossed the sodden field in the rain to meet with Alduin and [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Gabriella Starsyx\|Gabriella Starsyx]]
- Alduin wanted access to the horde to interrogate the barbarians and the safe release of [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Void\|Void]], who had been captured trying to sneak in
- Ogdin wanted to avoid the intrusion of external justice into his group, but agreed that if the shapeshifter remained dangerous and wouldn't return the Orb, he should be brought to some justice
- They agreed on Alduin setting a bounty of 5,000GP for the return of the fugitive and the Orb, which Ogdin's horde would take up.  However, Ogdin insisted that if the fugitive showed remorse and offered to take the oaths of the horde it would be offered mercy, but the Orb would still be turned over.  As a show of good faith he ordered the release of Void
- On the way back to [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]]'s ranch, the party was hailed by a cloaked figure.  Suspicious, they didn't approach him, but he tried to rob them at gunpoint
- He attacked not only with a weapon similar to [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]]'s, but also with a series of small bombs, one of which created a fog cloud that flummoxed the party before they dispatched him in combat
- They were able to recover some of these bombs, along with Pi'za absorbing the essence of the man's weapon
- Back at Nira's farm, she found that Sheep #38 was missing
- Long Rest
- Level Up! (2->3)
- In the morning Feannag and [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] poked around at the bombs they had found, successfully disassembling them and reverse engineering ice, acid, and grease bombs.  In the process of reassembling them Feannag set off the ice bomb in his face, losing the existing bombs but gaining the knowledge of how to make more
- Nira and Cock tracked the missing sheep to the river's edge, where they saw tracks leading straight into the water.  Nira felt a slight mental pulse of energy through the Crook of Command that indicated the missing sheep was below the river bank
- Together they rappelled down the overhanging bank and saw that there seemed to be an underwater cave entrance down there
### Session 10
*Greenwake 45*
- After the cave-in the party called out to [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]] but there was no response
- [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin The Anvil\|Ogdin The Anvil]] and [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Gudbrand the Elder\|Gudbrand the Elder]] arrived, hearing the cave-in from outside.  Ogdin was upset that they had been separated from the rest of their team and that [[People/Player Characters/Feannag MacDamhan\|Feannag MacDamhan]] had snuck into the trial
- The party persuaded Ogdin to let them continue the trial and they began their search for Aired, Feannag was brought back up for healing and questioning
- They discovered that the blood of the Kruthik has a pheromone that repels them, so [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] kept the vial open to ward off ambushes
- Two Adult Kruthik blocked their path, and after a failed stealth check by [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]] a fight broke out.  [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]] went down and was being dragged away by a Kruthik, nearly dying in the process before Wrenn was able to use the immovable rod to keep him in place and drive the Kruthik off
- The party took a short rest and harvested a large spine from the Kruthik they were able to dispatch, then continued down the tunnels
- In the cavernous **Underdark** [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]]'s keen eyes were able to spot the tracks of [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Grund Razorclaw\|Grund Razorclaw]]'s group going deeper into the hive then returning with fewer tracks, the party decided to follow them back up the tunnel to the site of the cave-in
- At the caved-in area they found two dead Kruthik with their spines removed, but no sign of Aired, [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Sigbjorn Hagisson\|Sigbjorn Hagisson]], or the Orcs.  There was a trickle of water flowing through the collapsed rubble
- Backtracking again, the party explored new tunnels, one of which had a steady stream of water running down it as they climbed upwards, the rushing water intensifying as they neared the end at a large boulder
- Nira shaped water and ice and Cock pushed to dislodge the boulder, revealing an opening to the outside at the foot of [[Places/Ogdin's Overlook\|Ogdin's Overlook]].  A downpour was causing flooding that drained into the tunnels, with thunder rumbling regularly
- Backtracking yet again, the party returned to the tunnels, but shortly heard the sound of gurgling breathing and splashing behind them
- Turning they saw what remained of [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Foke Barnswaggle\|Foke Barnswaggle]], now covered in slimy fish scales, barnacles, and poisonous spines since he had been turned into a [Sea Spawn](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/sea-spawn), presumably by the hag he unknowingly served
- Rip was forced to kill Foke as he attacked and tried to take the *Hag Eye* Amulet, delivering his final mail as his body floated off down the rushing water in the tunnel
- Delving deeper into the flooding tunnels, the party stopped to plan, realizing that they were running out of time between [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]]'s threat to attack [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin's Horde\|Ogdin's Horde]], Aired's disappearance along with Sigbjorn who they presumed to be the shapeshifter, and their dwindling resources as they were repeatedly attacked by Kruthik in the tunnels.  Finally, they decided to return to the surface to tell Ogdin that they were done with the trial
- Stepping out into the howling wind and driving rain the party saw no guard at the top of Ogdin's Overlook, instead flashes of lightning illuminated a chaotic scene on the field before them.  With regularity, every minute a brilliant bolt of lightning would strike the ground, leaving behind a kneeling paladin in glowing plate mail to join the growing ranks of Alduin's force.  Across the field Ogdin's horde clamored and chanted in defiance of the new threat
### Session 9
*Greenwake 44-45*
- While the rest of the party was arrested and entering into the trials, [[People/Player Characters/Feannag MacDamhan\|Feannag MacDamhan]] tailed [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Foke Barnswaggle\|Foke Barnswaggle]] and saw that he was speaking to the amulet and missing an eye
- He convinced Foke to hand over the Amulet of Clarity (wrapped up so the hag couldn't spy) and to go to [[Places/Geshtai's Chapel\|Geshtai's Chapel]] to seek healing from [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Brother Collamir\|Brother Collamir]]
- Feannag then snuck past the guards and joined the party in the tunnels clearing out the Kruthik
- While exploring the side tunnels, [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]] saw a glimmer that turned out to be the reflection of his torchlight on a solid polished steel wall
- The party followed tunnels along the wall and came across four young kruthik devouring a corpse.  After dispatching them and harvesting their spines the party saw that the body belonged to a deep gnome named L'Arsene, who had been on an expedition to find some sort of lab filled with dangerous experiments
- Looting L'Arsene's backpack revealed a set of tools used to dissect monsters and harvest their components for crafting, along with her Guide to Monster Hunting, a Bag of Colding, and a set of goggles that can identify crafting components on corpses
- [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] and [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]] also found a small black pseudodragon hiding in the pack, and after patiently enticing the animal they were able to convince it to join their party for now, Rip named the dragon [[People/Other Adventurers/Pointy\|Pointy]] for its stinging sharp tail
- Following along the curving steel wall in the tunnel the party came to an alcove with a huge steel door with warnings written in every language, they decided not to try to explore the lab at this time
- Next they found themselves in a humungous cavern filled with bioluminescent fungi, their first true taste of the immensity of the **Underdark**.  From here they could see the curving steel dome of the lab exposed and seeming very out of place in this natural cavern.  They also saw a herd of Roth√® grazing in the area and a continuation of the Kruthik tunnels leading deeper into the nest
- They doubled back, trying to get away from the steel wall that was hindering the transmutation detection of the Amulet Feannag had obtained.  When away from the wall it was still active, its eye aimed squarely at [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Sigbjorn Hagisson\|Sigbjorn Hagisson]]
- Realizing they were in great danger, the party stalled for time and used the Sending Stones to contact Alduin, asking him to send in Void to help
- Short Rest
- After two hours of stalling they realized Void wasn't coming, Nira left the tunnels and spoke to the barbarian guard who said they had caught someone trying to sneak in, when she heard a crash behind her
- Back in the tunnels the party was being hunted by six adult Kruthik that caused a cave-in to separate the party into groups to be easier prey.  Rip and Feannag nearly died, but they, Nira, Wrenn, and Cock were able to drive off the monsters
- Sigbjorn and Aired didn't fare so well, and they were nearing death when Sigbjorn's demeanor changed, he threw down his axes and his eyes glowed an eerie blue as he released a powerful burst of psionic energy, crushing the two Kruthik and knocking Aired unconscious
- The last Wrenn saw through a gap in the rocks was that burst of energy before the rest of the tunnel collapsed, completely locking Aired away with the shapeshifter
### Session 8
*Greenwake 44-45*
- Returning from their excursion to *The Beastlands*, the party spoke to [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Grund Razorclaw\|Grund Razorclaw]] who seemed keen on returning to the hunter's paradise with the rest of his orc clan.  The group decided to warn [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Clarence\|Clarence]]
- They went to [[Places/The Bursting Barrel\|The Bursting Barrel]] but Clarence wasn't around, [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Nora Gremble\|Nora Gremble]] hadn't seen him in the last day, but she and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Dutch 'The Boozer King' Ottenbrau\|Dutch 'The Boozer King' Ottenbrau]] were concerned because they hadn't seen [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Gerthwin Bartelby\|Gerthwin Bartelby]] since last night, and they were worried something happened to her
- The party lockpicked their way into Gerthwin's room and gathered evidence: large bootprints that seemed to stagger on the way in and walk steadily on the way out, evidence of a struggle, Gerthwin's apron with blood on it, and a chest in the closet with all of the valuables in place except a large spherical indent in the papers
- They brought Dutch in, noticed his shoes didn't match the bootprints, and assumed that it must be one of [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin's Horde\|Ogdin's Horde]]
- [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]] told the party about his mistrust of [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Grund Razorclaw\|Grund Razorclaw]] and the other orc in the Horde based on his dark past
- On the way through town they noticed two posters by the bridge indicating a reward for two children that had gone missing last night: 500GP for [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bitts Goldcrest\|Bitts Goldcrest]] and 10GP for [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Zuri Xibloes\|Zuri Xibloes]]
- Went to Ogdin's camp, where they met [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Sigbjorn Hagisson\|Sigbjorn Hagisson]] and convinced him to take them to meet [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin The Anvil\|Ogdin The Anvil]]
- Ogdin, while concerned for his friend Gerthwin, was offended that they would pin the blame on his group of reformed convicts.  He mentioned that he brought most of his group back before midnight and Gerthwin saw him off, leaving only the new recruits ([[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Grund Razorclaw\|Grund Razorclaw]], Grath, Grall, Gruk, Grum, Griz and Sigbjorn) to keep drinking at the tavern
- They went to question the orcs, but they were largely unhelpful, and Grund almost seemed to recognize Aired before bumping into him.  All of their boots seemed to match the profile of the prints on Gerthwin's floor
- As they left the camp they were arrested by [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Orbital Strike\|Orbital Strike]], who had been tipped off to the bodies in [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]]'s barn by [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Foke Barnswaggle\|Foke Barnswaggle]].  They noticed Foke had the Hag Eye necklace on when they saw him.  [[People/Player Characters/Feannag MacDamhan\|Feannag MacDamhan]] used his stealth to avoid capture and snuck away
- Back in the guard's headquarters [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]] revealed that they believe Foke to be the shapeshifter, and [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Void\|Void]] has been tailing him, seeing him acting shady and being near where the children went missing
- The party told Alduin what they found in Gerthwin's room, and [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Gabriella Starsyx\|Gabriella Starsyx]] went to confirm their evidence, returning to say she believes the Astral Orb was in Gerthwin's possession, and the fugitive is likely in Ogdin's camp
- Alduin, enraged that the shifter may be trying to escape or take on a form that is more adept in combat, warned that he plans to call in backup from his order of paladins and make war on Ogdin's Horde if need be to eliminate the fugitive
- The party convinced him to wait one day so they could try to get close to the horde and smoke out the shifter
- Under the cover of night they snuck out to Ogdin's camp and spoke to [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Gudbrand the Elder\|Gudbrand the Elder]], who doesn't trust the new orcs and was willing to get them into the initiation trials to get close to the newcomers, since he doesn't want to see the horde infiltrated
- [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]] used detect magic to search the camp and didn't find the orb, but picked up a bunch of magical armaments and a magical ring in Grund's tent
- Long Rest
- The next morning they entered the trials to join the Horde, and up on [[Places/Ogdin's Overlook\|Ogdin's Overlook]] Ogdin rolled aside a great boulder, revealing an entrance to a cave system that lead to the **Underdark**
- The recruits were split into two teams (orcs and party+Sigbjorn) and told to go exterminate a hive of [Kruthik](https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/monstres.php?vo=adult-kruthik), alien reptile-insect hybrids that burrow through the ground in the Underdark and perpetually need to be driven back or else they would erupt onto the surface.  Each person was given two flasks of Alchemist's Fire to fight the monsters and told to bring back as many spines as possible to show the successful eradication of the hive
- After an hour of searching the dark, dank tunnels the party was ambushed by Kruthik and barely managed to drive them off, killing 3 and taking their spines in the process
### Session 7
*Greenwake 43-44*
- [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]] played [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Grund Razorclaw\|Grund Razorclaw]] in [[Dragzin's Gambit\|Dragzin's Gambit]] to try to get some information out of him
- The party went down to the docks of the fishing village and stole a rowboat (no one from the town saw them but a few guards on a barge watched them)
- After two hours of searching in the dark [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Saoirse\|Saoirse]] appeared and asked them how clearing out the Grung went.  She thanked them with an *Amulet of Clarity*, which can detect transmutation magic such as a shapeshifter
- [[People/Player Characters/Feannag MacDamhan\|Feannag MacDamhan]] asked her very pointedly about who she was and the party caught her in a few lies about the Grung and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Goop\|Goop]], then [[People/Player Characters/Rip\|Rip]] cast detect magic and saw that she had an illusion on her, at which point the party attacked
- [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Saoirse\|Saoirse]] dropped her disguise and revealed herself as a *Sea Hag*, then tried to sink the boat and drown the party for revealing her ruse
- They fled, [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]] patching up holes in the boat, Feannag rowing, and the rest of the group attacking the hag to drive her off
- [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] repaired the rowboat and cast *Identify* on the amulet to determine that it was actually a *Hag Eye*, which allows a hag to see and hear through it
- They buried the amulet near Nira's outhouse
- Long Rest
- Grund appeared at Wrenn's door at dawn, and they helped upgrade his axe
- The party gathered and went into [[Places/The High Forest\|The High Forest]] to investigate the druidic runes
- Grund transformed into a Dire Wolf and read the incantation, which opened a glowing green portal within the tree
- Aired went through, and the rope they tied around him went slack, and he returned to beckon the party through
- They were transported to *The Beastlands* an outer plane and the place souls of those who were at one with nature go to rest when they die.  The sky is a brilliant blue with huge towering white clouds, the sun is directly overhead beating down on the savannah they stepped out into, and there is a dense forest surrounding the plain.  Animals are everywhere, antelope, zebras, meerkats, and eagles to name a few
- They spoke to a talking meerkat who explained the Beastlands to them and how Clarence is a petitioner, a soul who is bound the the body of a horse in the Beastlands, but he returns to the *Material Plane* often through the portal in the tree.  The conversation was cut short when Grund in wolf form attacked and killed the meerkat, feeling a primal hunger and need to hunt inherent to the Beastlands
- Wrenn revived the meerkat and it fled, but then they were charged by a magical [Rhinoceros](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16996-rhinoceros) that was able to cast spells, which dropped Rip to 0HP before it was taken down by the party
- Some were compelled to eat what they had killed, but then they opened the portal and went back to The High Forest
### Session 6
*Greenwake 43*
- [[People/Player Characters/Cock\|Cock]] woke up in [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]]'s barn loft and as he grabbed his gun and journal he was shot by a halfling rogue who wanted to take him out to steal his weapon
- [[People/Player Characters/Feannag MacDamhan\|Feannag MacDamhan]], [[People/Player Characters/Nira\|Nira]], and the rest of the party were nearby and were able to help dispatch [[People/Adversaries/Xanla Dustfeet\|Xanla Dustfeet]] and her mercenaries
- Upon killing Xanla, Cock's weapon Pi'za absorbed the essence of her weapon, becoming stronger in the process.  It also mentioned that he must learn to detect other "Black Saints" who would be after him
- Nira, not wanting three bodies in her barn, tried to dump the bodies in the river, but was caught by [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Foke Barnswaggle\|Foke Barnswaggle]] in the process.  His head was heavily bandaged and he seemed disoriented, but when he saw the bodies he ran to tell [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]] he suspected Nira of being the shapeshifter.  They ended up leaving the bodies in the barn
- Went to [[Places/Geshtai's Chapel\|Geshtai's Chapel]] to check on [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Simon Sais\|Simon Sais]] and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Iwana Sais\|Iwana Sais]], where they met [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Brother Collamir\|Brother Collamir]] and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Sister Tasarda\|Sister Tasarda]], who said that her pregnancy had been hijacked somehow by a powerful being.  Nira recognized this as something an evil fey might do, and Wrenn inquired if Iwana had made any sort of deal, then remembered how her mother's ghost had been apologetic and assumed that it was her mother who may have made the bargain
- As the party left the temple a huge herd of barbarians, mostly men, dwarves, and orcs, marched into town.  This was [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin's Horde\|Ogdin's Horde]] and they were in town for their equinox ritual
- The party went back into [[Places/The High Forest\|The High Forest]] and read the runes on the tree they saw [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Clarence\|Clarence]] walk into, Cock was able to decipher that they said "Door to Paradise" and there was some kind of incantation in druidic as well
- On the way back they also found some mushrooms that might be useful to brew tea
- Back in town, [[People/Player Characters/Aired Helelar\|Aired Helelar]] reunited with some drinking buddies who are members of the horde, including [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Thorgeir Thrumpek\|Thorgeir Thrumpek]], [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Gudbrand the Elder\|Gudbrand the Elder]] and [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Ogdin The Anvil\|Ogdin The Anvil]] himself, who were making a huge mess of the [[Places/The Bursting Barrel\|The Bursting Barrel]] and drinking heavily
- The group gambled with the horde, playing a game called [[Dragzin's Gambit\|Dragzin's Gambit]]
- They asked if anyone in the horde knew druidic, and Gudbrand sent them to [[People/Other Adventurers/Ogdin's Horde/Grund Razorclaw\|Grund Razorclaw]], a new recruit and a druid, who was dismissive of the runes calling them fairy tales, but when [[People/Player Characters/Wrenn Lingenhall\|Wrenn Lingenhall]] offered to upgrade his battleaxe he agreed to help them recite the incantation
- As they shook on it Aired noticed a brand on Grund's hand: the mark of a group of orc raiders who burned down his village years ago, a skull with three claw marks through it
### Session 5
*Greenwake 42*
- After discussing how to set a trap to catch whatever was banging on Simon and Iwana's door, the party followed [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Clarence\|Clarence]] on his midnight trot into the woods
- Though he spotted them and ran away, they were able to track him to a clearing with a huge ancient oak tree
- The group was spotted by a group of territorial [boars](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16812-boar), which attacked, dropping Rip to 0HP, but they were easily dispatched by the group.  Aired opted to knock them unconscious rather than kill the beasts.  Rip started a small forest fire
- Feannag noticed Clarence run behind the oak with a green flash, and after chasing him he saw the tree closing up some sort of magical doorway.  Upon further inspection Aired noticed some druidic runes carved into the roots
- After managing to put out the forest fire, the party returned to camp following Nira's skein of yarn she'd laid down on the way out
- Short rest in Rip's nest
- Feannag set up a stakeout across from [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Simon Sais\|Simon Sais]] and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Iwana Sais\|Iwana Sais]]'s house, saw a figure approach and bang on the door in the dark.  The rest of the party arrived and Wrenn recognized the zombie as Cima Fanteaser, Iwana's mother
- After banging on the door unsuccessfully for a few minutes the zombie shambled off down the road to the graveyard followed by the party
- Nira, Rip, and Cock kept it distracted with mage hands while Feannag and Aired ran to the Crescent's Rest to get help from Alduin
- Alduin quickly dispatched the [zombie](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17077-zombie), and a [specter](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17017-specter) rose out of the body, which the party and Void quickly subdued
- Finally calmed, the spirit of Cima was able to communicate that her daughter was in danger, she was pregnant and the baby was some sort of monster.  She said she was sorry and was finally at peace
- Alduin commented on how the group seemed like a budding new adventuring party, Nira disagreed wholeheartedly.  He said they should look into this matter in the town since Orbital Strike was looking for the shapeshifter and didn't have time.  
- Feannag went to the graveyard and buried the body, everyone else went home to sleep as the sun rose
- Long Rest
- Level Up! (1->2)
### Session 4
*Greenwake 42*
- Party discussed moral implications of destroying Grung spawning pool
- While about 2 miles north of town a small figure appeared and stole Wrenn's 100gp pearl
- The party chased but it escaped all grapples with slippery oil on its skin and using small dimensional rifts to flee.  Party opted not to chase into [[Places/The High Forest\|The High Forest]]
- Saw [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Clarence\|Clarence]] walking around in the forest, Nira called him over and fed him some hay then they all went back to town
- Back in town they saw the villagers queueing up to go into a small booth set up with a magical aura around it
- Feannag snuck up to it and overheard [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]] interviewing villagers one-by-one for info on the shapeshifter.  He was using Zone of Truth to get secrets out of people, and guards were marking off names from the book when they had been vetted by Alduin
- Aired went in for an interrogation, passed easily, Cock went in and was detained for not being able to answer truthfully due to his failed memory
- Nira was able to vouch for him to get him free of the guard's quarters
- Feannag and Wrenn had no interest in being interrogated, wanted to sneak away and avoid Alduin
- Feannag stealthily tracked [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Bailey Fanteaser\|Bailey Fanteaser]] back to his house with the book of names, then stole the book, crossed his own name off, and left the book on Bailey's porch
- Went to see [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/'Greasy' Greg Gremble\|'Greasy' Greg Gremble]] who was able to identify the slippery and sticky goo they collected from the goblinoid thief as coming from a Boggle, a bogeyman chaotic evil fey who use trickery and thievery to cause mischief and steal shiny trinkets
- Sold Orange Grung poison to Greg, who examined it and said it had nothing to do with the poisoning of the water supply, suggested the cursed fluid could be from some sort of evil fey in the area
- Party set about gathering shiny trinkets to try to catch the Boggle in a trap behind [[Places/The Bursting Barrel\|The Bursting Barrel]], Feannag bought stuff from the market and Wrenn polished up steel armor scraps from [[Places/Tam's Forge and Blacksmith Shop\|Tam's Forge and Blacksmith Shop]]
- Managed to catch the Boggle, who answered questions in exchange for shiny "treasures"
- It's name is [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Goop\|Goop]], and it lives under Bailey's house and fucks with him constantly.  Traded trinkets for Wrenn's pearl and a small magic item.  Goop also mentioned that the vile liquid smelled like "her," some mysterious mistress who hurt it before.  
- Rip cast Alarm on [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Simon Sais\|Simon Sais]]'s door to try to catch the culprit of the banging
### Session 3
*Greenwake 41-42*
- Short rest at [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/'Greasy' Greg Gremble\|'Greasy' Greg Gremble]]'s house while he used his alchemy equipment to analyze the well water, was able to distill a black curse fluid out of the water, which Aired took.  He also mentioned it could be from something evil or poisonous living in the water and contaminating it.  
- Greg also mentioned that he was working on Lightning Resistance Potions with the Shambling Mound fluid and that they should bring interesting fluids to him for trade in the future
- Went to [[Places/The Bursting Barrel\|The Bursting Barrel]] and spoke with [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Nora Gremble\|Nora Gremble]], [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Gerthwin Bartelby\|Gerthwin Bartelby]], and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Dutch 'The Boozer King' Ottenbrau\|Dutch 'The Boozer King' Ottenbrau]], while Nora was feeding [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Clarence\|Clarence]], who seemed to have miraculously healed from his injuries the night before
- Went to the docks of the fishing village, met [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Yarr Xibloes\|Yarr Xibloes]] who offered to take them out to look for the mermaid in the morning
- Went back to The Bursting Barrel where Tony's Pajamas were found, [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Void\|Void]] was already there, they described the danger of the shapeshifter and how they'd been tracking it for over a year since it's kind wiped out their village somewhere among the stars
- Long Rest
- Woke up early and went out with Yarr to find the mermaid by the waterfall
- [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Saoirse\|Saoirse]] introduced herself, said she'd been living in the lake for years but the poison was ruining the water, must be coming from a village of poisonous Grung upriver spawning in the waters
- For some reason they then threatened Yarr and gaslit him into believing they didn't find a mermaid
- On their way back through town they saw a crowd around [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Simon Sais\|Simon Sais]] and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Iwana Sais\|Iwana Sais]]'s house, upon further inspection they found [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Reka Rearguard\|Reka Rearguard]] dead, clearly killed sometime in the middle of the night and found in the morning.  She had blunt trauma and a nasty bite taken out of her side, then she likely bled out.  She had a shovel with her.  
- Feannag interviewed Simon, he said he heard the banging on his door again and a scream around 3am.  Investigation cut short when town guards arrived and took over.  
- Trekked into [[Places/The High Forest\|The High Forest]] along the [[Places/Dessarin River\|Dessarin River]] for about 2 hours, found some Grung in the shallows of the river guarding a spawning pool full of tadpoles.  The [Grung](https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/monstres.php?vo=grung) tried to chase them away, fired a warning shot and the party attacked and killed all but one who fled and went for backup.  
- While the air filled with the sounds of Grung in the trees the party considered whether or not to destroy the spawning pool and the ~300 tadpoles in it.  Nira blasted the pool with Sacred Flame before they fled
- Aired took a sample of Orange Grung Poison
### Session 2
*Greenwake 41*

- A town meeting was called, led by [[People/Other Adventurers/Orbital Strike/Alduin Silversmite\|Alduin Silversmite]] and [[People/Grey Hawk Citizens/Reeve Fona Goldcrest\|Reeve Fona Goldcrest]], announcing that there was likely a shapeshifter in their midst.  The shapeshifter is dangerous and can assume anyone's form, so villagers should travel in groups of three for safety.  An investigation was being conducted to track down the shapeshifter.  Tony's Pajamas were found behind [[Places/The Bursting Barrel\|The Bursting Barrel]], so he was likely the shapeshifter and has taken on a new form

- Greg was in the middle of trying to "milk" the fluids of a [Shambling Mound](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17011-shambling-mound), a powerful plant monster of the High Forest.
