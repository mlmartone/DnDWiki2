Yugin is a Goliath who serves under [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Thunivel\|Thunivel]] as one of the elite strike force members of the Black Saints.  He wields devastating firepower but isn't particularly bright.  His illicit weaponry and secret allegiance is unbeknownst to [[People/Arnesport Citizens/Taln Wolfheart\|Taln Wolfheart]], the Pirate Lord whose fleet employs Yugin as a captain.  Also he REALLY likes grapes.
